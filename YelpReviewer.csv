By the time I was done, I was starving! I hadn't been to this location since our kids were teenagers and I didn't realize that they started serving lunch about a year ago. After I was finished with my work I sat in the bar and looked over their lunch menu. I really had a hard time trying to decide but it came down to the lasagna or the meatball sandwich. The bartender told me the lasagna was her favorite of the two so I went with it. It was much better than I expected and was comparable to my homemade lasagna. Even though the lunch portions are ""lunch"" size it was almost more than I could eat. I was glad I didn't go with a salad or garlic bread because I would have definitely over indulged. The only let down was I was so hungry that I forget to take a picture to post here. If you're in their neighborhood stop in for lunch.
I can't say much about their family style dinners since it's been so long. It was always a fun atmosphere with a small group and a great place to feed teenagers. It sounds like that part hadn't changed."

Went there for my birthday recently and had an absolutely fabulous time. The food was delicious but you have to know what to order. The meatballs, meatballs, meatballs galore! Do yourself a favor and order the Brussels sprouts, garlic cheese bread and a pizza too! Also don't forget a few 22oz beers ;)
The servers are friendly, the atmosphere is ridiculous and festive and the laughter fills the dining room and goes through the roof. The place is clean and well maintained, decorations everywhere.
Highly recommended :)"

It's perfect for a large group of hungry people. Portions are huge! You'll have food for days!
The decor of the restaurant is basically your classic Italian restaurant.
The place is also kids friendly. Kids get crayons to draw.
The servers are also really nice and efficient."

Atmosphere: very old school traditional/stereotypical Italian restaurant with the red & white table cloths and Christmas decor all around. Large pasta sauces every where and pictures of people that have eaten there on the walls.
Food:
Huge portions - they only feed 3 (small) or 5 (large) and there's still plenty for leftovers. I come here with my partner and we get the small, and between the two of us, we can get in a total of 6 meals (so once sit down and 2 times eating the leftovers). But that applied mainly to their Sunday Family Dinners which I think is the best deal. You get garlic bread, salad, sausage, meatballs, and a giant bowl of ziti. We've come here many times for this special and it feeds up halfway through the week. Highly recommend!
+ We've come here for their other pastas as well and I have not been disappointed with their flavors. If you come here just for the pastas, I'd recommend coming with a group because if you order just one dish, there's a lack of variety. That's why some people complain about the prices. It really should be family style.
Overall, I highly recommend Bucca for their Sunday Family Dinners and Half Off Meatball Mondays. Otherwise, if you come here with a large group, it's good to order just a few dishes to share to offset the prices."

Went there for lunch with a party of a dozen people on a weekday, and we were one of the first parties to arrive. Mid-size interior with interesting decor. Services was pretty good.
Their menu has individual-portion options, but they also have a lot family-style options that's meant to serve a couple of people. We ended up ordering two salads, three pastas, and two tiramisu cakes for dessert. The salad, pasta and garlic bread servings were huge. We probably finished less than half of the food. I like the garlic bread and the tiramasu. The pasta and the salads were alright. Lots of quantity, but average quality. Two of the pastas looked and tasted kind of the same even though one was supposed to be spicy. Overall, a decent option to feed Italian food to large parties."

Please hire safe drivers that won't curse and scream out of their cars while making illegal turns in a buca vehicle. It was absolutely insane.
This is regarding an incident around noon on 5/30/19.
I was in a right turn lane on Howell and Boren turning, when the buca car pulled up next to me (from behind) in the middle no turn lane. Oncoming traffic made it impossible to make the turn for a bit, but seems like she got impatient.
She pulled up and started screaming obscenities, pulled up in the middle of the intersection, illegally blocking, then made an illegal turn while continuing to screech at me.
So angry Seattle driving, just in a buca car and on meth.
Not a great look.
Please sit down and have a conversation with your staff about driving like normal people.
I road rage too--everyone does from time to time. But your drivers endangered people around them, and that driver at noon today should not be driving for you, let alone on the road to begin with.
In terms of food, I did like the pasta month a couple months back. The pappardele was great. But it's not worth supporting a business that endangers peoples lives."

Heck, I even would have given this location 3.5-4 stars a few years ago. However, on Monday, I came in with a friend and everything about our experience was lame.
They were understaffed to the extreme. It seemed like there was almost nobody working there. No greeter, one waitress...Our food took over 25 minutes to make. Further, I waited more than 15 minutes for my virgin Mojito. I ordered the chicken Limone. This has been my favorite dish at BDB for a long time. I was really disappointed with my dish. The portion of chicken was so small and it was completely flat taste-wise, (all butter with very little spice). The same was true for my Alfredo side. Thankfully, my friend ordered the spicy rigatoni. His dish was good and about a 4 -star."

And guess what, corporate never called me, I never got my refund. Run from this place, they take your money but don't deliver you food. Just ridiculous!
Update due to comment from Bucca di Beppo Customer Service:
Bucca di Beppo Customer Service, please don't lie in Yelp saying that you are concerned.

Much bigger space with views of the lake and city. The only thing missing is the Chefs table which the fire department declared illegal which is a shame. I've always wanted to sit there but oh well.

This place, besides being slightly hard to find, is the cutest little nook in downtown Seattle. You feel as if you're in a completely different world vs the touristy pike place corridor.
We arrived around 6:55 PM and were pleasantly surprised it was still happy hour. The deal is actually quite good - $4 off cocktails! I ordered a mezcal cocktail (what's new?) and husband ordered old fashioned. We asked for them less sweet and they turned out great. Mine had a ginger syrup which was different vs most mezcal cocktails I've ordered!
For food, ordered brussel sprouts and beet deviled eggs to start, and split the mussels and burger for the mains. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the server. They were good, not great. Felt like I could make them myself and wouldn't order again for $12. The deviled egg was the perfect party in my mouth and something I had never tasted before! It had a slice of anchovy in it which sounds odd but tasted amazing. Burger was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy bun. The fries were cooked crisp to perfection. Mussels were in perhaps the best sauce I've ever had.
Overall food was so tasty, service was quick and attentive despite restaurant being completely full, and menu comprehensive! Will come back for sure - especially now that we know HH runs until 7 pm on weekdays!"

That being said, the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Wild Mushroom Farro, and it was the best farro I've ever had in my life! The flavor was completely balanced, with no one ingredient dominating the dish. I was also impressed with how they incorporated huckleberry into the dish. On top of that, the sauce - which I'm told was just vegetable stock with butter - was phenomenal. My only minor complaint was that some of the cauliflower was burnt. But the dish was so perfect in every other way that I can definitely overlook the cauliflower."

I appreciated the vibe and that it wasn't super crazy loud. We got to hang out at a standing table and order our first drink before a table opened up, but it wasn't long until one did even though it was Friday night. The drink selection was awesome, and everything we ordered was great (and cleverly named). We also enjoyed our reasonably priced olives and Marcona almonds... good food, great drinks, nice vibe..."

Cool, chill, vibe. Super low key. Little bit hidden but follow the signs down the stairs. We didn't have to wait and were seated right away. We got two cocktails and be warned they are super strong.
They have a large selection of different kinds of drinks as well as a late night menu. We didn't try any of the food but it all looked amazing."

There's so many places to choose from right here in the Pike Place Market area. Lucky me, I landed at Zig Zag!
Service from Anna and Erin was spot on a dm fabulous. Technically, I believe Anna was my server yet Erin bought several things and was very attentive as well. It kinda worked as tag team service and that was just fabulous!
All the food was spot on, they had plenty of gluten-free options and the happy hour wine was very good.
My only complaint is that I ate way too much because the food was so great! My hotel is around one plus miles ...uphill. Ugh. It'll be good for me, right?!? Super good, I'll be back!"

That was absolutely delicious. The yolk just gushed out everywhere. Felt like I was eating a breakfast sandwich one minute and then the next second a bacon cheese burger. Also the cheese just oozed out of everywhere. Very delicious. The fries were a bit too salty for my taste though. Score: 5/5
Their snacks were very boring. The baguette with the cultured butter was good though. It comes toasted but my only compliant is that I eat too fast and the outside of the bread is too hard :(
The cheese platter was smelly!!!! It's not my cup of tea but I'm sure other people will love it"

Great cozy restaurant and their service was fantastic. Small selections of wines but they were really good wines and reasonable.
Ordered A charcuterie plate, fried oysters, burgers and mussels. The plate was so tasty and the meats were perfectly cured, their mousse was just melt in my mouth.
Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.
Fried oysters were my fave. Small size and sweet. Everything we ordered was just divine. I would go back there for HH next time. Sooo laidback vibes and the foods were excellent!!"

Your answer: Zig Zag Cafe. Skillfully tucked away from Pike's Place market, close to the waterfront, Zig Zag offered superbly crafted cocktails and the perfect aperitif options to take a breather prior to continuing our tour of the city.
The lighting is dimly lit with old antique bottles of wine (some unopened) and cozy red lighting that makes you feel stuck in time. Each table is decked out with a candle as humble chandeliers decorate the ceilings.
We ordered a dish of deliciously tasting green & black olives with the perfect amount of garlic and zest. Complimented by a dish of pita bread and heated hummus (spiced with paprika and garlic), the food was delicious! For my cocktail, I ordered an aperol spritz - aperol campari mixed with good quality prosecco and orange zest with enough punch to keep me going.
Overall outstanding dining experience. Highly recommend! A+"

I've heard a lot of good things about Zig Zig and I'm so happy I've finally made my way there to experience it myself. I ate the fries and deviled eggs off their late night menu. I loved the sultry smokey ambiance and the bartender was great. I just loved watching the art that goes into crafting their perfect cocktails.

We had deviled eggs, the pork skins, and almonds and olives for snacks before dinner at Cutters. The eggplant dip with the pork skins was the highlight. It was silky smooth, and not like baba ganouj, if that's what you were thinking. There's an off-menu cocktail-with-a-story, if you're interested. Called the Chas, it's bourbon, Cointreau, and other potent tastiness. A Pike Place institution, you must come to Zig Zag if you're in Seattle."

So many fun drinks and yummy snacks. They have one of the most extensive cocktail menus I've ever seen and it was hard to decide on just one (okay, two) to try. For snacks we had the fries which have a great balance of salt and dress black pepper and the crispy pig skin which came with a fantastic aioli.
We arrived around 5:30 and were able to get a seat on their small patio, but the inside looked nice too if the patio is full."

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Kevin M.,"An amazing, lovely restaurant with a beautiful view on the inside and out.
Came here for a special occasion with my S.O. Started with a half bottle of local wine and their meat and cheese board. The meats varied from fatty, to hard, to spicy, to earthy. The cheeses were a medium and a soft cheese. Sides of spicy mustard and slightly sweet jam. This was a delicious board that we almost finished in its entirety.
For dinner I had the rigatoni with meatballs. And she had the lasagna. Mmmm the rigatoni was cooked perfectly, with just enough of a bite. The sauce was bright and fresh, if not a bit sour. I would personally add a bit of sugar to offset, but it was delicious nonetheless.
I had a few bites of the lasagna, I have tasted few lasagnas that come close. The spinach gave the pasta an elegant green hue, and their cheese was melted to a perfect cream consistency. The layer of pesto really gave this dish the richness that made it so special. Highly recommend the lasagna.
Finally, we finished off with espresso and their cheesecake. The cheesecake was hazelnut flavored and was very good. The hazelnut creme was just sweet enough. If you are a fan of hazelnut you will like this. Otherwise I could have done with a different flavor cheesecake.
Overall the food was fantastic. And the location and decor made dinner that much more special. I couldn't imagine a cozier restaurant. Dinner felt intimate. And the service was good. I will be back!"
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Ryan J.,"The Pink Door is as amazing as everyone else claims it to be! From the unseemly entrance to the beautiful view and decor, this place has earned its prestige as one of the best Italian restaurants around.
With a place that is so well known in Seattle, they are quite humble with their entrance. Walking thru a not so busy alley, if you see a Pink Door you've arrived at the right place. Upon entry, you can see the cozy intimate decor. And in the back they have a fantastic view of Pike's Place waterfront.
They have a great selection of items on their menu that are both exquisite and delicious. My GF and I ordered the Pink Door Lasagna, Special squid ink pasta with mussels and shrimp, Arancini and Tuscan Fries to share. The TUSCAN FRIES WERE AMAZING! They fry it with sage, rosemary, and garlic which gives it a subtle yet addicting flavor. The Arancini was quite good, but I was truly impressed by the Lasagna. Although it comes in a small dish, this is really all you need. Layers of spinach pasta packed with rich bechamel sauce and pesto and marinara was to die for. This is certainly one of those dishes you eat slowly to just savor all of the flavors.
This is definitely a must try for those who love Italian food or just want to spend a romantic night out with someone special. Just make sure to reserve a table early in advance."

Wow, the view and ambiance were amazing here. I recommend reserving an outdoor table if you can! The view is so nice and there's something about eating outside here during the day that makes you feel good.
The lasagna was delicious. I kept raving about it while eating! The service was great. The Pink Door is a charming place to stop by for lunch or dinner if in Seattle."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Tamara D.,"We've been looking forward to coming here for weeks. I'm so glad we made reservations because when we got there 5 mins before opening, there was already a group of people waiting. By the time we were seated, the place was almost filled up.
I'd remarked on our reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary (15 years!!) and when we sat down the server brought out complimentary glasses of Prosecco for toasting. What a special touch!
We ordered several things I can't pronounce but this has to be one of the top tasting meals I've had. I always tell everyone about Mesa Grill in Vegas as the place I've had my best meal ever but this definitely rivals it. Such friendly staff, such great service, we will be back every time we are in town for sure."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Sebastian T.,"This place not only has a great rep, but it can also back it up! I've come here a few times and I've always had great experiences. It is a pretty big space with lots of interesting features: aerial shows in the main dining room, live music, an amazing patio and inner section of the restaurant with gorgeous views of the water. This spot is really popular so I'd highly recommend reservations or you're easily looking at a 60 min+ wait.
While entrees here can cost $20-30 each, its nice to see that it's not fine dining to the extent where its tiny portions, but you get a nice hefty plate with great preparation. While the food I've had is good, it wasn't shockingly amazing. A solid 4/5 but you're really coming here for the overall ambience. I'd highly recommend coming here at least once to check it out! This place also is an amazing date spot!"

I really appreciate the consistency of the quality of food and service! The perfect restaurant for casual dining with family or friends, and a romantic date night!
Winter Risotto | Must. Order. Creamy butternut squash risotto that warms up your entire heart...
Linguine Alle Vongole | The signature dish of pink door! This pasta dish never goes wrong; the white wine broth really elevates and balances out the flavor of the clam. Love this simple yet delicate dish!
Cioppino | Never a big fan of tomato broths but this one's different. The amount of seafood is worth the price and the tomato broth is light and smooth, so you won't get tired of it!
Northwest Fish of the Day | Not a must order, but good quality fish! The salmon is seared to perfection with a crispy layer of fatty skin and tender meat on the inside!
Tuscan Fries with Fried Herbs | The aioli is so tasty that we can't stop snacking on these fries!! Wish the flavors of the herbs are stronger..."

You definitely need to reserve table if you want to sit in the main dining. My advice will be a week before to be on the safer side.
Went for dinner on our first anniversary. Didn't reserve the table early, so got the slot at 10:15 pm. :( but got the table with the best view.
Food is always good. They have one of the best oysters in the city. So highly recommended. Other foods are also good.
Only sad thing is they don't have lot of optIons for the people who are allergic to red meat and shrimp. So that was a bummer for my wife.
But still would like to go back again."

Imagine my surprise and happiness when we snatched up an available lunch time that worked for a party of 2! We were also visiting from out of town, so really happy that it all worked out.
You can also be on standby and wait for a table, but it can be a long wait.
FOOD
We ordered the rabbit ragu pasta and cioppino soup.
The rabbit ragu pasta was better than I expected. The meat was tender, and the pasta had texture.
Cioppino soup was delicious! Exceeded my expectations a lot. There were plentiful pieces of seafood. I would recommend dipping the complimentary bread with the soup. I was full after the dish.
SERVICE
The servers were very attentive with refilling our water.
PARKING
It's in the heart of pike place where post ally is. If you are driving, there are parking available nearby."

Linguine Alle Vongole - obsessed with this dish. Baby clams in shell, pancetta, garlic, chilis in a light white wine sauce. Clams for days, linguine perfectly al dente.
Lasagna - an interesting house version with super thin sheets of spinach pasta, layered with bechamel and pesto, topped with marinara - flavorful artistry, no dull, heavy lasagna here.
Crab risotto - chockfull of crab! A beautiful risotto, albeit not as interesting as the linguine or lasagna
Service is friendly and professional - have always enjoyed excellent service at the bar. Reservations are recommended as waits can be formidable during peak hours, but if you come by on a whim, just put your name down and enjoy a drink at Radiator Whiskey, Rachel's Ginger Beer or any of the fun bars nearby!"

Not that I paid particular attention, but from memory it seemed like Pink Door has been all over my Yelp feed since forever--I think every foodie that lives in Seattle, or has been to Seattle, has Yelped this place. So, I had to...
But for those that aren't from Seattle, or I guess I should say for those from California cause I heard other states have similar, but it appears many restaurants, even the really popular ones are REALLY REALLY REALLY hard to find. Like I tried to get to this popular bar the next day and it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor with NO SIGNS outside the building. Really no way to know how to get there without being told...
and yeah, so Pink Door is one of those. First, it's in an alley. Luckily the GPS does hint at that. BUT, I spent the longest time trying to find the entrance cause there's NO SIGN outside, and THERE IS NO PINK DOOR (unless I'm color blind?) The door IS NOT PINK. So, if you see this plain door but hear some trance or other form of electronica, this is probably the place, so you can open the door.
Yeah, so trance... when I walked in, there was a girl hanging from the ceiling on a rope, dancing in the air like a ballerina, accompanied by some trance. So, it's a mostly-traditional Italian restaurant food-wise, with an extremely modern vibe. Interesting.
Food though is above average but not particularly great...
1. Pink Door Mocktail (Non-Alcoholic) $8 ""bartenders seasonal creation"": Don't. Unless you wanna pay $8 for a lemonade. Mocktail my ass. 1/10
2. Cup of Riobolita $10 ""the traditional Tuscan vegetable & bread soup w/ cannellini beans and parmigiano reggiano, a wooden spoon should be able to stand up in the pot"": I did try to stand a spoon in it... and waddya know, it fell but got pretty close. I think if it were a normal sized spoon it might have done it! Think of this soup as a vegetable stew, with just a little but of French onion topping. As for the ""bread soup"" part, I'm not sure where the bread went--maybe as a thickener? Anyway, it was okay, but not particularly special. 6/10
3. Cioppino Pink Door $27 ""prawns, rock fish, mussels, clams and clamari in a spicy tomato and white wine broth"": Compared to others I've had, the soup here is pretty thin and super peppery, though I did enjoy the abundant seafood flavor. It's also served piping hot, which was nice compared to other restaurants. The mussels were tiny, but cooked absolutely perfectly with super plump flesh. The fish was just okay--not dry but definitely not moist. Shrimp was good and still crunchy, but not really what I'd expect of ""prawns""--they're just the same shelled, curled shrimp you see in standard Chinese food. Strangely, there was absolutely no carbs served??? No toast, no nothing. Weird huh? 6/10
4. Flourless Chocolate Cake $11 ""port wine, poached seckel pear, pomegranate port sauce"": Well, this is NOT a cake--but the waiter did warn me, so I guess I can't fault them too much for the false advertising. It's basically a chocolate bar of gaunache (fancy word for semi-soft chocolate) with a braised pear on top. I did like the tart sauce that was packed with berries, but otherwise there wasn't much to this dessert. But I suppose, if you're a true chocolate lover it might float your boat. 6/10
I am really tempted to give them brownie points for just being really cool, but honestly I wouldn't go back cause the food wasn't worth a second visit and I'm sure there are less fancy but better tasting Italian restaurants in Seattle, so...
(but I do think you should come here once sooner or later just to experience how weird and modern a ""traditional"" Italian restaurant can be while still being ""cool"" and without being annoying.)
Oooooooooooooooooh f it.... I guess it's worth a special visit just cuz... (but seriously, the food is just a 3)
4/5

The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Jessica M.,"Came here for my birthday and I had the perfect experience. They had no more available reservations but accept walk-ins. We read from previous yelp reviews to expect a wait so we stopped by a little earlier to put our name and number down. We were told a 45 minute wait and our table was ready for us by the time we made our way back.
For starters, we ordered the Crostini Ai Funghi (mushroom on grilled toast). The mushrooms were flavorful and the toast was crispy! I love Linguine alle Vongole so this was a must. Definitely the highlight of the meal. Clams were fresh and the linguine was cooked to perfection.
Although the place was packed with people, our attentive server was able to bring out our meals quickly. This is a great restaurant for date night or hanging out with friends. Highly recommend - just try to make reservations beforehand."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Jennifer K.,"This was probably one of my top favorite dining experiences in all of my travels. My husband's friend had mentioned this place, otherwise we would've had no idea and weren't planning on eating here. It's actually pretty hidden and you definitely need reservations, which I managed to get pretty last minute (visiting off season in January). The interior is very unique, it has an art deco/1920's vibe which I love. They actually have live trapeze artists on weekends, they perform above you while you eat. Unfortunately we missed that being a weeknight, but it was still a very entertaining evening. They had live jazz performers, and the atmosphere is just so lively. It has a beautiful view of the water if you're lucky to sit in the back area.
The food was delicious! We had Lasagne with besciamella, pesto, & marinara *new york steak with twice baked potatoes *caesar salad with crab and *maple creme brulee."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Katie Y.,"God, I just love this place. The first time I came here was for my 16th birthday (quite a few years ago.. yikes), and the last time I came here was over 10 years later. It's just as good, if not better, than I remember it.
We came here right when it opened on a weekend, put our name in and got seated maybe 30-45m later. I'd recommend making reservations in advance if you can. The restaurant is a little hard to find the first time, walk down Post Alley and literally look for an unmarked pink door. Inside, it's surprisingly big with high ceilings as you walk down and start to realize how eclectic and funky it is inside.
The hype is so real about this place. We ordered charcuterie (both meat and cheese boards) and both were fantastic. The pastas did not disappoint, the risotto basically tastes like butter.. but in pasta form, if you're into that (butter, that is). Honestly, everything I've ever tasted here has been nothing short of amazing. If this place weren't so hard to get to (in an alley of Pike Place), hard to find parking, and hard to get reservations/a table, I probably wouldn't wait so many years between visits."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Douglas R.,"The Pink Door is straight fire.
Background: In Seattle for a weekend getaway with my wife this place came on my radar. We had wanted to eat here on previous trips but didn't make it. I knew this place must be the real deal because we couldn't even get a reservation for the Sunday of MLK weekend. Surrounding days only had reservations for like 9 oclock or later. Reminds me of The House of Prime Rib in San Francisco in terms of difficulty of getting a reservation.
The Wait with No reservations: We showed up at 8 and were seated by 9:15 at a great table in the lounge. While we were waiting we scored a couple of seats at the bar and had drinks. Time went by fast as we enjoyed our drinks. Bartenders were super friendly and accommodating. My wife can't have gluten and they were awesome about making her a lemon drop with a grain free vodka.
Ambiance: One of the coolest most unique places I've ever been. Great live entertainment, dim lighting perfect for a date night.
What we ordered: Drink wise we went with a lemon drop and an old fashioned (2). Great drinks.
Winter Risotto: My wife ordered this and really enjoyed it. It comes gluten free too which she was super excited about.
Lasagna: Man this was a straight smoke show. Damn it was delicious. Mind blown.
Mixed Greens: Solid standard with a vinaigrette dressing.
Service:Great all the way around.
Bread:Complimentary bread before the meal. So nice that they had gluten free bread for us.
Prices: I felt like they were super reasonable for the quality of food and experience you get here.
Final Thoughts: Such a great night out. Thanks Pink Door. If you can't get a reservation don't let that stop you. Show up about an hour before you would have made your reservation time and just grab a bar stool. Have a drink and take it all in."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Lisa E.,"There is a reason The Pink Door has so many great reviews, it is pretty fabulous. Is it a bit touristy and right near the fish market? Yes...but it is not just a cliche tourist joint. The Pink Door has great food and atmosphere! I have never had a bad thing here.
If you like oysters, get their oysters. They are delicious, and I love their peppery vinaigrette mixture that comes with it and the presentation is lovely.
I have had their seafood specials, pasta specials and just salads here and have never been disappointed. My customer once had a risotto here that she said was a bit bland, but other than that I cannot think of any complaints.
The bar makes fabulous drinks, and they have a great variety of unique liquors. The entertainment is what I believe the Pink Door is known for, and the hostesses do a great job trying to accommodate all patrons trying to see the stage. The atmosphere is grand and a bit over the top as you would expect. In general this is great for a cozy date, or even a lively business dinner. All clients and colleagues I have brought to the Pink Door have not been disappointed."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Tazeen L.,"Great spot with a fun atmosphere, great views, occasional music and good food... came in without a reservation and had a 1.5 hr wait for a table for 3 on a Saturday night. Service was friendly and helpful, ended up sharing a few things:
-lasagna- recommended by waiter and definitely the winner - great balance of ingredients, well seasoned, everything you want out of cheesy comforting plate of pasta
- cioppino- seafood was fresh & tender, could have had more variety (mainly mussels and shrimp). Broth was light, could have used more seasoning
- pappardelle- noodles were al dente, ragu was good
Overall good spot if you can get a reservation..."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Ce O.,"Came for our last supper in Seattle. We had Spiced Wine and The Butler to drink. To eat, I had the pappardelle bolognese. My partner had the lasagna. Both dishes were delicious but we could have used several more bites of each. I imagine that they don't make the main entrees larger so that you'll buy dessert. However, we don't eat sweets so we left feeling unfulfilled. The entertainment was a delightful added bonus, though. To get the full enjoyment of the experience, I'd recommend requesting cornered seating, so that half the party's backs aren't to the performer. Otherwise, give it try!"
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Stephen C.,"Arguably the most famous Italian restaurant in Seattle. After visiting I can understand why it sometimes can take months to get a reservation at this establishment. The Italian cuisine is on point and the service is impeccable. The restaurant seating is split between a lounge type of seating and a main dining room. We we were unable to get seating within the main dining room and sat in the lounge seating - personally we enjoyed it very much and it was very fitting for lunch. I would not let the unavailability of main dining room deter you from visiting the restaurant.
For drinks, we opted for the freshly squeezed mimosas. It was very well prepared. For appetizers, we ordered a side salad, which was amazing, the perfect amount of dressing and the presentation was great. We also ordered a dozen of the few oysters. As expected the oysters were very fresh and the accompanying mignonette sauce was perfect.
For the main entrees, we opted for probably the most popular dish on the menu, the clam pasta (linguine alle vongole) and also an order of the bolognese pasta. Hands down maybe the best bolognese I have had outside Italy. The clam pasta was also superb, loaded with fresh clams, and with the perfect amount of wine sauce. On a side note, we really appreciated how the restaurant made special arrangements to prepare a children's portion of the bolognese and they were able to plate it earlier than the rest of the meal.
Finished the meal off with an spritz, which would highly recommend for a brunch.
Overall, very pleased with the dining experience at Pink Door. It is no wonder why this restaurant continue to top the list of most popular restaurants in Seattle."
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Natalie K.,"This is a great Italian spot in Post Alley, it's a little hidden with the Pink Door... come early cause wait time usually is anywhere to 1-2 hours. And reservations are booked 60 days in advanced. You might get lucky and snag a seat at the bar
It's a cozy restaurant with dim lighting. Every night they do have live music/ entertainment.
We had a great server, he notified us that the menu changes every week/ holiday season so the pictures that you see you may not be able to order on the menu
To drink we started with Hennessy Sidecars ... can never go wrong
The Pink lasagna... sensational it didn't have meat but the sauce was impeccable and something like you probably have never tried before
The scallops were perfectly seared and crushed with potatoes and a sautéed spinach
The next dish was a Bellachini with Italian sausage... it was a little dry but still yummy with a cheese bite to it.
For desert we had a gelato tri and a chocolate cake with a chocolate coated pear... very rich but nice way to finish dinner off"
The Pink Door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 443-3241,Clarissa K.,"This place I had bookmarked by recommendations from my fellow Yelp friends. I should have prepared better as it was truly hard to find located near Pike Place Market on a path that was a back alley. I did not realize that the door is truly a pale pink and in the dark the only way you will know you arrived. But it added to this great find and mysterious local and surroundings. Once inside you feel like you are in London in a hidden location in a basement.
So the wait for a table would be an eternity especially on a Wednesday cold dank evening in November. Luckily there was two seats at the bar so that is where we had our dinner. The menu was unbelievable like reading a poem each one you wanted to try. We sat next to all the regulars they seemed so happy. Great place it truly is one of a kind. We started with a anchovy dip with raw veggies. It was interesting as well as delicious. The main course I shared with my colleague any menu loses me when I see pappardelle noodles with Ragu a la Bolognese sauce. OMG to die for! We had a nice wine to compliment the meal as well as made it warmer before entering the cold Seattle night air. Grand Marnier Panna Cotta with fresh figs for a sweet ending
Will definitely return on my next visit to Seattle."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Joey J.,"Worth the hype. Great mix of flavors on all the dishes. The pasta was my favorite, but the sleeper may be the onions stuffed with sausage. Those were unreal and were generally eaten in one bite.
Cocktail list wasn't too expansive but they had something for everyone. Wine list is extensive and the atmosphere is pretty intimate. We had 5 pm reservations on a Tuesday and the place was packed by the time we left around 7.
Beef cheek was fork tender and dissolves in your mouth."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Trang L.,"This restaurant is a must try if you are in Seattle! The hand-cut egg noodles tasted so fresh and perfectly al dente. The pork and beef ragu on top of the egg noodles were good, but a little bland for my taste. I've never had a cabbage salad that tasted so good. The prosciutto and egg added great texture and blended well with the crunchy cabbage. I'm not sure what kind of dressing was used, but it was delicious. The trout was crispy and full if flavor. Finally, the prawn risotto was amazing and a must try! I was so full and didn't have room for dessert.
Restaurant is small and intimate. Service is great!
I would rate this restaurant a 4.5 if I could and would come back again."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Stephen K.,"Summary: If you solely come here for a specific pasta dish, you will leave satisfied. But everything else is as unmemorable as it gets- from the service to the house bread to the dessert to the $30 trout (more on this later).
Elon Musk. Stephen Curry. Bill Gates. The Backstreet Boys. What do these transcendent cultural icons all have in common you ask? They went against the grain. Against popular belief. And that is what I must do in saying, aside from one pasta dish, Spinasse is an average restaurant. To say I was hyped to have snagged a reservation on a weeks notice in one of the hardest restaurants to book in the city would be an understatement. And ya know, maybe the high expectations I came with me doomed my experience from the start so I'll take some culpability in the an overall experience that was just really average.
Nestled on the outskirts of Cap Hill, Spinasse exudes a romantic, intimate vibe from the moment you walk in. So at this point I'm thinking okay, this is my last meal with my significant other before they leave Seattle, and we gonna go out with a bang! Spinasse said nah, check yo self.
SIDE NOTE: It's a huge pet peeve of mine when restaurants try and make their menu a version of Webster's Dictionary Word of the Day that us peasants can't understand. Degustanzione, braciola, guancia, tajarin, barbabietole, who knows what these mean! Smh. But I suppose the Italian adds a flare to the authenticity and I'm probably just being dramatic since at least there are descriptions.
We ordered:
1. Tajarin con burro salvia (4/5 Stars) $15 small portion: The ICONIC hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage was light and flavorful. And it also tasted exactly like the Butter and Sage Gnocchi from Trader Joe's. The dish could have perhaps used a little bit more kick, but nonetheless I enjoyed it and marveled at the texture of such finely cut thin noodles. I've never quite eaten a noodle like that, and this brother has had a lot of noodles believe me.
2. Tajarin al ragu (5/5 Stars) $28 large portion: This dish was exemplary. The pork and beef ragu perfectly complimented the egg pasta, and even tasted a little sweet. And honestly, for all my asian noodle folks out there, the first thing I thought of was this meat tastes exactly like the mince pork of Rou Zhao Mian!!! Just Italian style. So that's probably why I loved it so much.
3. Agnolotti dal plin (3/5 Stars) $16 small portion: This is where the meal started going downhill. The agnolottis were absolutely tiny and filled with beef and pork. And while it didn't taste bad, the agnolottis were drowned in shaved cheese and left you feeling simply unsatisfied. I felt like I had to ration every one which was eaten in a half a bite because there were so few and each was so small. Granted we did get the small portion, but if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck, this ain't it.
4. Trota (2/5 Stars) $30: I almost fell out of my chair when this came out. Imagine a rectangle in your head, and and add a little fish tail to the end of it. That's exactly how the trout came out. I appreciated the fact that all the bones were plucked out, and the salsa of sage and golden raisins underneath was quite good- but the star of the dish is supposed to be the trout and it was so unmemorable. It had little to no flavor, and the presentation of a rectangle + tail left much to be desired. I was upset I didn't order another large of the tajarin al ragu with Trout money.
5. Torta al cioccolato (2/5 Stars) $11: The table beside us ordered this dish, and it looked SO APPETIZING. Plus I was desperate to salvage the meal and end it on a high note. And while the dark chocolate cake with buttercream wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. It tasted like a chocolate cake. It wasn't moist inside, but it was rock hard either. Nothing made me want to eat more, and I ate it out of the immigrant mentality of no food wasted upon which I was raised.
I would come back for the beef ragu, but that is it. I will also say our server again wasn't rude or bad, but she also didn't enhance the overall experience. She seemed a little disinterested and went through the motions, and did not provide genuine, heartfelt hospitality. Of course, we aren't entitled to amazing service by any means, but when a restaurant does have that amazing hospitality, it adds so much to the experience.
TIP: For $105/person, Spinasse has a deal where the table shares every single appetizer, pasta, and main entree dish on the menu (slightly smaller portions but still a good deal)."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Ellen C.,"Wow, their pastas are really really delicious. The noodles are really thin which really brings out the flavor. Based on the yelp reviews, we ordered 2 half order pastas (the ragu and the butter/sage), a kale dish, and the onion stuffed with meat. Everything was delicious and between the 2 of us, we were absolutely stuffed.
I loved that they offered reservations for a Saturday evening at 6:30PM. I also did make the reservation about 1 month in advance. Parking was really easy since it was an early dinner, and was able to find street parking right next to this restaurant."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Ivy L.,"My friend loves this place and was absolutely adamant that we do our annual girl's holiday dinner here this year - so much so that even though the restaurant was booked, she called and left a message and was able to secure a reservation for us weeks in advance. I wasn't going to argue, I love pastas and homemade pastas are the absolute best! We had reservations during the holidays for a table of 5, and everything was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Parking wasn't horribly bad since it was on the outskirts of Capitol Hill, not in the mist of all the bars/restaurants/busy areas. We were able to find decent street parking quickly on a Friday night at 8pm. The restaurant itself is small and can be easily missed cause we definitely walked right passed it and had to turn around and walk back! It is a tiny little entrance right next to Altura, if you pass Altura by a lot, turn around! The is a double door leading to the interior to block out the wind, which is a nice touch. The interior is rustic and lightening makes it look like a candlelit tavern. The only complaint I had was the chairs - they were so so uncomfortable, it actually took away from my dining experience cause of how sunken the woven seats were and how erect the back was - please get new chairs!
Our server was quick and super friendly. We ordered a round of drinks, the Aperol Spritz was light and refreshing. We ordered 1 appetizer, 3 pastas, a main, and 2 sides to share between 5 girls and I thought the portions were definitely small. We were an ok full, but definitely not stuffed and could have maybe used a bit more food. The large pasta dishes were indeed on the smaller side, especially for the price. With that said, the pastas were good. We ordered the Agnolotti Dal Plin - little small pillows of delicious goodness. The tiny pillows were stuffed with such a flavorful concoction of meats and cheeses, beef and pork filled Agnolotti with a Double Brodo and Marjoram goodness to be excact. They were a burst of flavorful and the pasta was perfection (5/5). We also ordered the Tajarin con Burro e Salvia - basically a butter and sage pasta. Super simple but so much flavor. The tajarin pasta is Cascina Spinasse's signature dish - the super thin pasta is rare in most restaurants and Spinasse does it well. Lovely flavors of butter and sage, definitely the perfect ratio (5/5). And lastly, for the pastas, we ordered the Tajarin al Ragu. Again, an amazing ragu sauce with the right amount of cheese and the thin tajarin that just lets the sauce speak for itself. Delicious, albeit slightly on the salty side, just slightly. (5/5). My favorite dishes were indeed the pastas here - we also had two sides of kale and brussel sprouts - nothing to rave about there but a bit of greens to add to our carbo loading! The server recommended the Cipollini Ripiene - Roasted Cipollini Onions Stuffed with Beef and Pork Sausage with Toasted Pine Nuts and a side of bread as an appetizer and it was delicious! We had a friend who doesn't like onions but the mixture was cooked so well, you can't even taste the onions cause of the stuffed sausage. A good spread for the bread service (5/5). I also loved the amuse bouche, complimentary of the chef, the butter and anchovies toast was the most delicious mix and I would never think to serve butter with anchovies on top. Yum yum yum! I wish we could've ordered this dish alone. And our last dish was the special of the night, Pork Belly with Potatoes. The pork belly was tender and flavored well, though it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. The restaurant definitely stands out cause of the pastas!
Overall, good experience and lots of delicious dishes. Pastas, amuse bouche and appetizers were all fantastic. The sides and pork belly fell a little short, though definitely not bad by any means. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the panna cotta - by far the best panna cotta we've had in a long time. The tiramisu was in a small jar and was just ok - I think the panna cotta just stole the show! Service was good, ambiance homey, but chairs need to be replaced for comfort!"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Jun Li Z.,"Came here solo as I had always wanted to try this place out - it was in December. Sat at the bar and the waiters and waitresses alike were all friendly. There was one waiter - I forgot his name but he was super nice!
Service: Terrific and professional - almost fine dining-like.
Food: Ordered the appetizer - squash with bacon and nuts on it; thought I'd needed this one because I assumed the pasta wouldn't be enough. It was yummy but I actually didn't like squash as much. Ordered the beef ragu pasta and OMG it was toooooo good! I would order this again and again. I heard the butter and sage was also delicious!
Pricing: Be prepared to spend a bit more than your usual fare for dinner or lunch. This place is pricey - their service and quality of food makes up for it as they should if they are going to charge that much.
View from the Bar: If you are on a date or just traveling solo - I recommend sitting by the bar. I really enjoyed watching the workers make the pasta live! It was so fun to watch! You get to see them cut the noodles and slice and dice it. They seemed like perfectionist and made sure all of them were equal in size!"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Sheryl K.,"I want to start by saying that this is my most favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've tried many pasta places in the city, but Cascina Spinasse is my go-to. I even designated this spot to be my birthday dinner restaurant!
I am absolutely obsessed with their butter sage pasta. I don't know what it is about this dish, but it's so delicious. I could literally eat this every day.
I've had several dishes that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the butter sage pasta is what always stands out and what keeps me coming back. I don't think I've had anything that I didn't enjoy here. They also have amazing desserts. The last dessert I had was their tiramisu. I'm not a huge tiramisu fan, but I enjoyed theirs. It was so flavorful and delicious.
The only thing that bums me out about this place is that it's so popular and sometimes challenging to get a reservation in. Sometimes we go as early as possible to see if we can get bar seating. It's usually a hit or miss, but if they can fit us in, I'm generally down to wait for them to clear up some space.
If you're into delicious, freshly made pasta like me, you need to come here! But I highly recommend calling ahead to see if you can get a reservation. Otherwise, try getting there really early when they open for dinner to see if they can fit you in."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,I L.,"Everything was good.
Would order again by deliciousness:
Agnolotti
Onion stuffed sausage
pasta tajarin el ragu
The egg with cheese fondue was a bit too heavy for us. We ordered tajarin butter and sage a few years back - it was way too salty. Not sure if it was just an off night.
Service was exceptional."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Jennifer O.,"I made a reservation for Spinasse four months ago and due to conflicts that kept coming up, I had to bump the reservation twice. I was so excited to come here with my hubby for date night last night and must say kudos all around.
Food: we usually splurge when it comes to date night and spared no expense at Spinasse. We ordered two small pastas, two entrees, a side of veggies and two desserts. We ordered the butter sage tajarin and the the agnolotti. The portions were definitely small which was perfect for shareable dishes. The tajarin was rich and buttery and kind of had this melt in your mouth aspect to it. It was good but i would likely get the version with meat my next time around. I'm a gal who likes meat. Then came out entrees. Hubby got the beef cheek dish and I got the trout. I was dumbfounded when what looked like an entire fish arrived in front of me - skin , tail and all! I was expecting a filet and that was def not what I got. It honestly didn't look appetizing at all but was well seasoned and damn delicious when I got into it. Hubby loved his dish as well. I liked how the flavors of both of our dishes were complex but yet light at the same time of that makes any sense. It was a sophisticated delight to eat. We had sautéed kale with our meal and while it was good, it was honestly a little too salty. Then came dessert. Hubby got the apple tart and I got tiramisu. Both were BOMB. The tiramisu was rich and creamy, so good. Highly recommend both! We left extremely satisfied!
Service: the food at Spinasse is 4.75 stars but the service tips it to 5 easily. As mentioned, we had a reservation for 6:45pm on Friday night. We arrived at the restaurant at exactly 6:45p and was seated IMMEDIATELY. So many restaurants fall short of this gold standard unfortunately. In addition to be being seated promptly, we were also tended to frequently and the wait staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
Atmosphere: small cozy classy restaurant but sans the 'tude. I can dig it. The restaurant is lively without being loud. Most patrons were on intimate dates and this is perfect spot for it.
Overall: excellent date night spot. Excellent food. Will return absolutely."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Rio D.,"Precaution: I'm very picky in general when it comes to food. I have very delicate pallet and I've traveled abroad a lot and gone to many restaurants. Especially when it comes to Italian, I tend to be a bit unfair because I'm used to Italian-Italian (lived there and visited many times.) So I should say maybe they are five but I just miss the authentic Italian. So four star. But everything else is good. Nice restaurant, service, menu, atmosphere, hip and trendy. Perfect for date night."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Alina H.,BEST DINNER EVER. Max was our waiter and was so knowledgeable and fun! He asked us lots of questions and helped us pick so many perfect courses. Service was insanely quick and some of the best Italian food I've ever had (outside of Italy)! Go go go go so worth it.
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Michael P.,"One of the first Italian stops in Seattle: @spinasseseattle
Get a reservation because seats are definitely hard to come by! If I were to recommend anything, the pastas are phenomenal. STICK WITH THESE. You cannot go wrong. Be blessed. Both tajarins are staples of the restaurant and are the only pastas that do not get changed on the menu.
1. Antipasto misto della casa: uva con gorgonzola (fresh grapes with Gorgonzola piccante, hazelnuts, chicories, and parmigiana-filo crisps), vitello tonnato (poached veal loin with tuna maionese, parsley, and fried capers), insalata di peperoni (roasted peppers with chickpea purée, boiled egg, and anchovies), and prosciutto di Parma (pio tosino 14-month aged prosciutto with fresh melon)
2. Tajarin al ragù: fine hand-cut egg pasta with pork and beef ragù
3. Agnolotti dal plin: beef and pork filled agnolotti with double brodo and majoram
4. Pancetta ripiena: prosciutto-stuffed pork belly with roasted marble potatoes and rosemary
Tongue? Blessed."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Madeline C.,"Absolutely wonderful experience, including the food, service, and atmosphere. We made a reservation which was a good choice as our table was ready right when we arrived. I loved the warm, cozy Italian ambiance. We had the stuffed pearl onions (cipollini ripiene) as an appetizer which melted in our mouths with every bite. Then, we split the pasta dish tajarin al ragu, which was very rich and delicious, along with a side of the Zucca (I was skeptical of squash but it was very good and filling with yummy nuts and and Parmesan on top). Definitely a bit pricey but so wonderful for a special occasion or date night!"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Derek B.,"I had high expectations going into this, and I was not let down. I get nervous when I have to give a credit card in advance for a reservation, but I was dedicated and ready to commit. This place had been on my list for a while. OpenTable only had reservations very late in the evening, and when we called via phone (the horror!), they were able to accommodate seating us earlier, which was amazing because I was exhausted.
It has a dark ambiance. I don't know what rustic actually means, but maybe it was that? The table was ready and set up when we got there, so that was appreciated. The server was very cool. And that didn't prevent him from being very polite and providing excellent service throughout the meal.
The bruschetta was not what I typically think of when I think of bruschetta but it was amazing. The tajarin is one of their staple things, and I enjoyed that. The cavatelli with braised beef short rib ragu was definitely to the next level goodness. At this point in ordering food, I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to eat more, but somehow that wasn't an issue when the food came out and ordering the pancetta was not a mistake.
We ended the meal with this chocolate torta thing that was so balanced - it wasn't too heavy or overly chocolately. And the grappa pairing that they recommended was so on point.
I will definitely be coming back. I appreciate the great service, the recommended pairings worked really well, and all of the dishes that were ordered were consistently excellent."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Thao N.,"Finally got the pleasure to come here to try out their famous butter & sage pasta. One of those small, intimate settings with the dim lighting that I appreciate, but that means no photos for you guys;) The plates looked tiny, but is actually very filling so I recommend you getting a few of the half size pastas for more variety.
Going back to the butter & sage pasta, literally all my clients have been raving this so I've had it on my radar for a while now. I think they used actual angel hair because it was magical. It's one of those food porn moments, where it enters your mouth and might explode from all the bomb flavor.
Highly recommend coming here for any special occasion; birthdays, anniversaries, death of evil boss, or if you're a foodie like me and love exploring new places on a random Tuesday to avoid crowds, although this popular spot is busy all the time.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Spat S.,"Top food and service. Sat at the bar on a Friday night, great atmosphere and could see the pasta being freshly made in the kitchen. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. Wines were amazing. Highly recommend the butter pasta staple, the ragu was also nice but didn't love it as much. Would definitely come back!"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Jennifer Y.,"Took an uber pool here - I suggest you do the same. Or walk? Seattle really isn't that stretched out the more you think about it.
Entrance is such a tease - what's behind those lovely white curtains? A magical place. Who knew that somewhere so cozy could exist on these cold rainy streets? There is one dining area (smaller) directly where you enter, then another (larger) adjacent to the left. The kitchen is visible through a glass windowpane where you can watch the pasta being made fresh and all the other happenings of the making of your food.
They're very friendly and understanding here. The moment you sit they ask you about any allergies or dietary restrictions. They're very clean - they clean every time they take away a plate. If you sit at the 'bar' - really it's just a nice view of the kitchen - they don't have hooks underneath the bar but they encourage you to hang coats on your seat or on their coat hanger hooks to the side.
Complimentary Crostinis
- Rabbit Liver Pate
Now I've never had pate so perhaps I'm just not cultured enough. But have you ever drank too much, then felt sick and thrown up? That after taste of thrown up alcohol is what this tasted like. I'm not trying to exaggerate or be overly rude, it's just exactly what this taste reminded me of.
- Butter and Anchovy
A lot of pepper. And a LOT of salt - tastes like extra salty fried fish. So, SO salty. Possibly too salty. But significantly better than the liver pate.
Tajarin con Burro e Salvia
Basically a very thinly sliced tagliatelle with butter and sage. This is a common combination but the first time I'd tried it. The sage didn't seem to mesh very well to me and the butter seemed almost like an aftertaste. The pasta however was undoubtedly fresh (not just because I'd seen them make it) but because it was so soft and rich. So soft it seemed like it should fall apart in your mouth but somehow still retained texture.
Carote Arrotiste
Huge, huge chunks of carrot. I wouldn't recommend getting this for one person because it could be a whole meal in and of itself. They were perfectly cooked but that's where the positives ended. Sweet then sour then various herb flavors - didn't seem like any of it meshed well together. The sour came through very, very strong."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Rosa K.,"I've been wanting to try out this place for so long and I finally got my chance! I came here on a Friday night (after 8pm) and I didn't make a reservation. I was hoping that since we got there around 8:30pm, we wouldn't have too long of a wait....they said the wait was 1.5 hours. SO DON'T FORGET- MAKE A RESERVATION! We weren't in a rush so we put our names down and go to the Italian restaurant next door to grab a drink and an appetizer (Artusi) while we waited (you can read my review for that separately :) )
We got the call around 9:45pm that our table was ready. We headed over there. I knew that I wanted to try the Tajarin but I couldn't decided if I wanted to go simple with the butter sage or the ragu. We decided to do BOTH. The pasta noodles were SO thin and just melted in my mouth.
Though the noodles were the same, the taste of the two dishes were so different. I did love the simplicity of the butter sage, but I felt that there was more flavor in the Tajarin al ragu (I love meat sauce). The butter sage had such a rich but delicate taste. The hint of sage elevated the pasta to feel elegant. The Tajarin al ragu is more of a homey taste. It has more ""umph"" from the tomatos and the meat which is right up my alley.
We got the smaller size of each of them and we were able to eat them both (even after our appetizer meal next door). The pasta noodles aren't as heavy and filling like ""normal"" pasta noodles which was a nice because I didn't feel as full or bloated.
The service was amazing, the waiter was so friendly- went through the menu, portion sizes and wine selection.
I definitely don't regret getting both the Tajarin dishes. I will definitely be back!"
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Owlburt L.,"Went here last Saturday with the wife and our daughter for a belated birthday dinner. I had been excited and had high expectations based on the reviews. I booked this over a month ago and was hoping for a great experience.
Unfortunately we were both quite disappointed. The service was good but that is expected for a high end restaurant like this.
The food, however, was a major disappointment.
We started with the Uva Con Gorgonzola and the Cippollini Ripiene (both highly recommended by our waiter). The Uva Con Gorgonzola was an interesting dish most of which is I have never paid $15 for about 10 green and red grapes cut in half with 5 crumbled pieces of cheese and some hazelnuts. The balance just wasn't there for us. The grapes were sweet, the dressing has some zing to it and the cheese was just too salty. The Cippollini Ripiene wasn't too bad but it was again, overly salted.Unfortunately the ""overly salty"" theme was to be repeat itself to every dish we ordered afterwards.
And I am someone who usually puts extra salt on everything. Hell I even have slightly high blood pressure because of the amount of sodium I ingest.
We then ordered half orders the Tajarin al Ragu and Agnolotti dal plin and the Pancetta Ripiena. Although all the dishes were not badly made, the fact that all them were overly salty, ended up overpowering any ""complex"" flavoring that might have existed under it.
With drinks our bill came out to abut $180 plus gratuity. In the end was basically $100 per person (since our daughter didn't really eat anything), which is way overpriced for something that was nothing special and overly salty.
We won't be back and that's unfortunate since we really wanted to like this place. I am not a penny pincher when it come to eating out, I don't mind shelling out the money for good food, but why pay 4 times more for something you can get at places Il Nilo or Il Corvo that is much better."
Cascina Spinasse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 251-7673,Dan C.,"I was looking for a good place for an anniversary dinner, and just did a web search for good restaurants for special occasions in Seattle. Spinasse was maybe the third one that came up, but they had me at fresh made pasta. And oh my, the pasta...
But im skipping ahead. The restaurant itself is nondescript from the outside, sandwiched between a couple of other Capitol hill eateries. Inside is clean and close, with a rustic feel. Depending on where you sit, you can watch pasta being made in the kitchen... long sheets of beautiful, yellow, eggy pasta... I'm getting hungry again..
Service was prompt, friendly, and generally fantastic, with care given to cleaning the table between courses and being careful to not touch the silverware and plates as they were being replaced. We even got an extra candle and a couple of Happy Anniversaries! towards the end of our meal.
The food was even better. To start, we had a poached egg in cheese fondue and a savory shallot flan served over spinach and topped with fried shallots. Both were excellent, but I could eat that flan every day for a year.
Main courses were pasta in brown butter sage sauce, and prosciutto-stuffed pork belly. The pasta was, in a word, perfect. The stuffed pork belly was pork stuffed in more pork, with an herbed demi-glaze, and roasted potatoes. Awesome.
I finished up with an apple crostata, paired with an excellent grappa, and my Mrs. had the lemon curd and ricotta layered mousse.
I've had meals all over the world, and this was in my top 5 best meals so far. The ratings already reflect it, but this is a restaurant worth checking out more than once; we literally started planning our next meal there about halfway through this one."
Brunello Ristorante,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 527-4778,Kathryn C.,"I had the most wonderful experience at this restaurant!
Tim, the owner, had an excellent wine special by the glass that paired perfectly with my starter of meatballs in a hearty marinara sauce. The meatballs were so delectable!
I appreciated the option of more Parmesan, fresh cracked pepper and red chili flakes throughout my meal as I like things a little spicy.
For the next course I had the Pomodoro Caprese and the tomatoes tasted so very fresh! The mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic and basil were top quality which all together made this delicious!
For my main course I had the Carbonara and if you are a fan of this creamy pasta dish with egg and panceta it does not disappoint.
To finish off my meal I had the in house made tiramisu and some limoncello. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Tim and his staff have definitely got the right vibe in this Ristorante Italiano with great conversation, fantastic wine and food and a comforting overall ambience. I will be back!"
Brunello Ristorante,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 527-4778,Jenny Z.,"WOW the food here is amazing! Ate the leftovers for lunch today and honestly just as good. We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. I booked through Yelp for the first time and it was quite convenient.
We came on a busy Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation. Even though we came about 10 min early, we got sat right away. We started with a bottle called Marchesi which is a sangio/cab blend (mostly sangio) which was light with main note of cherry. I did wish it had more cab since we like fuller body wines, but the lightness ended up pairing well with our meal.
For apps we ordered the olives, caprese salad and caesar salad. Olives came out hot which I had never had before! It was flavorful and tasted amazing with their bread. The caprese salad was a generous portion and fresh tasting. Caesar was good as well. I added anchovies which were extremely salty...almost cured? I would pass on that next time, especially if you're expecting fresh anchovies like I was.
For dinner I ordered the seafood special. Husband ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken (after reading the review that the person could die happy after eating it lol). Both were amazing. I personally liked the seafood dish more. Very fresh seafood and perfectly al dente pasta. The gnocchi dish was rich and creamy and the chicken was tossed on top, which cut the creaminess in a good way.
Overall food tasted delicious and authentically Italian and will definitely be back to try more pasta. Next time we will definitely try the carbonara which had raving reviews. I also enjoyed the wine list which offered wines from several Italian regions. It's always nice to try a bottle you can't normally order from a Seattle restaurant. The ambiance was really nice and felt like you were transported to a little Italian restaurant in Trastevere.
The downside for us was the lackluster service, especially for a birthday dinner. Friendly server but forgot several things (forgetting to put in our appetizer order, asking several times whose birthday it was despite me writing it into the notes of the reservation and telling him, asking me to remind about the bday dessert, giving us another table's filled out receipt instead of my card back, etc.)
Just a little bit more thoughtfulness would have made the birthday dinner less chaotic-seeming. Good thing husband does not care all that much about bdays :) All in all a very nice dinner despite the unconventional service lol."
Brunello Ristorante,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 527-4778,Elly S.,"I really want to like this place. It's very convenient with a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and a variety of tasty food options. Both times I've been, the food has been slow to come out but this isn't usually more than a nuisance, especially on busy nights. However, on Saturday night my husband's order was lost/forgotten, and he ended up waiting about 15 minutes longer for his food - a large seafood pasta dish. They were very kind about the mistake and even comped a couple desserts. In hindsight, though, I worry that the staff rushed to make the food in order to address the error, since my husband has had symptoms of food poisoning since the morning after, and undercooked seafood seems a very likely culprit.
Again, I want to like this place, but I don't think we will go back. For those who do go, I recommend the tiramisu and would steer clear of any shellfish."
Brunello Ristorante,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 527-4778,Monica K.,"We celebrated our friend's birthday here for dinner last weekend. The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group fairly well.
I enjoyed the burrata appetizer - it was my first time trying burrata, and I thought it was good (though I have nothing to compare it with). I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.
What stood out for me the most was Tim, who served us that night. He was extremely energetic, joyful, quick, and funny. He handled our large group with grace. I really appreciated the extra effort he put into giving us a positive experience!"
Brunello Ristorante,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 527-4778,Mike N.,"Led to Brunello by the 4 1/2 star rating. While I was expecting an old style neighborhood Italian restaurant, I was underwhelmed when I walked in. It was a bit more ""rustic"" than I anticipated. Menu was mostly pastas but also had chicken and veal entrees. But this was ideal for the evening as I was looking for pasta along with the Huskies I was feeding. I ordered the only homemade pasta on the menu, the gnocchi with red sauce and meatballs. The gnocchi pillows were really good. However the sauce was way too spicy to my liking and I like heat but in this case it took away from the gnocchi. And the smallish meatbballs were bland. Service was excellent. You can expect a decent meal just don't come with expectations that you'll be blown away which a Yelp rating like it has will do."
Brunello Ristorante,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 527-4778,Kristin B.,"April of this year when I went to Brunello. I had gnocchi with marinara sauce, which is one of my favorite dishes. It was delicious! I am all about sauce and this dish had it. The sauce was plentiful and tasty. The gnocchi was on point. If you're in the Roosevelt neighborhood, I would definitely make sure to give this Italian restaurant a try.
Accessibility: This place is accessible. There are no steps to get in nor any booths to worry about. It will be a tight squeeze when it is busy though. The flooring is raised tiles so it may be bumpy for any wheelchair users. I do not remember the washroom situation. I would inquire."

The menu had a great selection, and the food we ordered was tasty. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and he had a seafood pasta special. The portion size is very generous for the amount of each dish. The wine menu was decent and the service was very good. Our only complaint was that the vanilla gelato tasted more like ice cream than actual gelato, so that was a bit frustrating."
Brunello Ristorante,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 527-4778,Mikala K.,"My husband loved his salmon pasta with lemon butter, capers and white wine sauce $29. I had the lasagna but lil too cheesy and very little meat or marinara sauce to relish on $14. The bread was actually bland but was improved by dipping it in balsamic vinegar and olio. Yet, if their entrees are this delish, then the bread should match the food quality. I highly recommend they try a better recipe or buy better tasting bread. I am a bread fanatic and unwarranted and unofficial bread connoisseur so if I dont like the bread, then the rest of the meal we be subpar automatically."

After reading the reviews we decided to book the restaurant for my birthday when we arrived we were given the menus and were offered to taste some wine, which wasn't good. Then we ordered a more expensive bottle of wine from Brunneli's brand but the waiter decided to use the same glasses that he brought the wine to taste. When politely pointed to get us fresh glasses, his attitude was rather unpleasant. The food was very average. The lasagna was disappointing. The calamari were too chewy. The Fish stew was fine.
We see big fans of Italian cuisine. So really unfortunate experience."

It's a small mom and pops kind of Italian restaurant which kind of makes you feel at home. The staff and waiters are super friendly and will make sure your water is never empty! Spectacular service. It was nice of them to offer all the dinner specials in a very well manner.
The food was just okay. I'm from Los Angeles and I was being too harsh comparing it to my favorite Italian restaurant back home. I got the spaghetti bolognese and fettuccini pesto. Both were a bit bland in my opinion. Meatballs were tasty though!
Overall, this is a nice date spot! They have plenty of wine options as well. Bye Seattle!"

Brunello Ristorante,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 527-4778,Felisa D.,"I had been at the restaurant that used to be in this location. It was also Italian. That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.
My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.
I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.
Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.
For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.
Overall, we would come back."

Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Natasha G.,"I've come to Tavolata twice now and while the overall experience is passable, my 3 star rating is bc nothing really blew me away. In my most recent visit, I came with a large party (14 people) for my friends birthday dinner. My first of three stars this place gets is for the service - we were able to create a customized tasting menu including appetizers, pasta, entrees, sides, AND dessert for the birthday, with a mix of veg and non-veg options to meet the needs of various people in our party. The waiters were friendly and attentive throughout, and I'll add another star for an ambiance that is good for special occasions with large groups to date vibes or intimate friend group dinners.
The food didn't wow me though - I've had much more memorable Italian in a 5 mile radius of this place. We started with a standard meat board (it's hard to mess that up), burrata that honestly was bland, and fried lard which tasted a bit rubbery and not fresh. The pastas (potato gnocchi and ravioli) were also just ok - the ravioli had a weird honey taste mixed with the savory sauce, and while some cuisines nail the mix of savory and sweet, I don't think Italian pasta is the right place to try it (at least this one). Finally, the pork chop was hard to bite, chew, and swallow - it honestly tasted like a dish you would get at a college dining hall. The farroto (off the menu veg item), as well as the rapini, however, were decent - the garlic/lemon zest on the rapini was a nice palette cleanse from the pasta and the farroto was a solid veg risotto. My third star is for those dishes. Finally, the lemon donut dessert was fine, but again, better donuts and dessert options within a 5 min walk from here (cue Salt & Straw, General Purpose, and Frankie & Joes).
If you do end up coming here for some reason, ask for the Farroto and rapini and it'll satisfy your taste buds while enjoying the vibrant ambiance. I wouldn't waste your calorie intake or $$ on anything else from here."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Lisa C.,"My husband and I decided to go here for my birthday. I had heard so many good things about it and it was an Ethan Stowell restaurant after all.
It was very unimpressive. The buratta appetizer with lemon curd like topping was delicious. But it ended there. That should have been recommended as a dessert, not appetizer. The eat if the meal, pasta, was overpriced for what it tasted like and the amount.
The most odd thing which may sound great... But was awkward for me was we had three different servers take our appetizer order and hence we were confused what was really going to come and if we would get duplicates. It all worked out as we tried to be clear that another waiter had taken our order. But I found that burden and all the interruptions very uncomfortable.
Anyway, I was underwhelmed."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Peter C.,"So so so much to like about Tavolata. Get the bread basket - it comes with this delicious spreadable cheese and balsamic vinegar. But the star is the spreadable cheese -it will blow your mind how flavorful it is. They didn't have any specials that night, so I played it safe with spaghetti & meatballs. But goodness gracious this is nothing like what you can make at home, and that's the whole fun of eating out. It's covered in a pile of parmesan with sturdy, firm noodles and it's SO good. Run, don't walk to this one. Slightly dim lighting so you might think it's a romantic date spot, but it's kind of loud on the inside, unless you're lucky enough to get a quiet corner somewhere. Anyway, just go and thank me later."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Camille W.,"My friend and I were exploring Capitol Hill and happened upon Tavolata and we were both pleasantly surprised! It happened to be 15 min before happy hour ended and the barista took our orders in just in time. One thing I will say is I do not think I would be as happy paying full price for what we got, which is why it is 3.5 stars.
We ordered the arugula salad, bruschetta, spaghetti, and rosemary gimlets. The arugula salad was crisp, cheesy, and lemon-y exactly what you're looking when consuming a bitter salad. It was actually my favorite part of the meal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The spaghetti was a little too anchovy-y which I found odd since I was searching for the salt and pepper shakers... the meatballs were good but the flavor was lacking. The pasta appeared to be fresh pasta but was just a tad too al dente. My friend and I both agreed within our first bite that it should've had more time in the hot water, but the parm shavings were a nice touch. The bruschetta did not come had we not asked about it, which was fine with us since we were working on our other choices, but I had to ask for that. But it was sourdough bread with a very unique dip and a side of olive oil and balsamic.
Sitting at the bar made me realize how tricky it must be to multitask all the aspects of a full menu and drinks for the whole restaurant. The gal at the bar handled it like a champ. The rosemary gimlet was actually one of the most memorable! Refreshing, perfect amount of rosemary taste and citrus and relatively strong on the gin, which is an excellent balance. Our bill was $30 each with tip which I thought was still on the higher end for what we got.
All in all, I would perhaps try it again if I were coerced into it but I don't know if the pasta made that much of an impression to me to come back. I've had better pasta elsewhere, maybe I just didn't order the right thing?"

We made reservations for 6 on Monday and got seated right away. I was interested in their happy hour menu as well and they were able to accommodate us for the bar area.
The menu was awesome for SRW - you get to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert on their regular menu!
- Brussels sprouts - filling, good texture, a little bland
-albacore with mussles - interesting, the albacore was thick cut and cooked medium rare. It was bland but went well with the mussles and sauce
-sorbetto - ice cream went well with the cookie, but wasn't sure where the sweet and salty came from as both was sweet. The ice cream was coconut lime and was good.
The HH menu was also awesome!
-bruschetta - fish was good and was a lot on the crunchy/soft bread. Flavor was spot on.
-parpadelle - favorite meat sauce, and the pasta was cooked perfectly
Price and portion for both menu was generous and I would definitely come back! Service was ok, not particularly amazing but better than what I expected. This is probably one of the best SRW restaurant Ive been to."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Cindy V.,"Lovely environment. Romantic for dates and a great spot for happy hour - Pasta dishes running less than $15 that are filling! My favorite from the happy hour menu is the rigatoni with spicy sausage. Delicious, makes me want to get more every time. The gnocchi is also decent, no complaints.
The chicken ravioli is super bomb, I definitely recommend this dish (not on HH). At first I thought this dish was small but was filling even though I was super hungry.
Bruschetta with smoked fish - the fish is amazing! Tasted very fresh. I just wish the bread was a little softer. It was a little too crunchy to our liking but still a solid appetizer. I also tried the olive appetizer before but didn't really enjoy it.
I've only gone here for dinner and the wait for the food is pretty long. Service is okay nothing spectacular. I would suggest making reservation to avoid long lines for the weekend since it can get pretty busy or if you want to sit at the booth."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Joey J.,"This place gets busy very, very fast. We were able to sneak into the bar area for some dinner. Cocktails were good, but the mai tai was very fruity. Espresso martinis were espresso forward.
The steak tartare was good, but almost too cold. I had the spaghetti with anchovy off the happy hour menu and it was the highlight. My wife had the tagliatelle with scallops, and she hated it. Scallops were diced up and the Alfredo type of sauce was off. It was honestly inedible but we were told it was a new add to the menu and delicious. It's also one of, if not the most expensive pasta on the menu.
I would go back for happy hour and just order off that menu. 4 stars without the tagliatelle factored in."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Simone T.,"Well I am biased, because I met the love off my life at Tavolàta when my friend and I were at happy hour one evening. I love this place so much and am so grateful for it. The pasta and bread spread is always delicious and hopefully we will spend our anniversary here for years to come. If you happen to go for ddinner make sure to get some bubbly as well because they have a wonderful selection to pair with dinner."

Ricotta ravioli: The ravioli had the perfect amount of chew. The Sauce was nutty, zesty and sweet, perfect with ricotta cheese.
Pappardelle: This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The handmade pasta was so good and the ragu sauce was just a little spicy and minty so not greasy at all."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Theresa L.,"Belltown as usual parking is horrible on a Saturday night. Luckily found a parking spot not far.
Booked a table a month in advanced. When we arrived we waited a little while but was seated fairly quickly. We sat at a shared communal table. Food came out hot and tasted great. Hand made in house pasta was perfect. The pork chop was so big, perfectly cooked. We enjoyed the pork chop over the beef.
We will go back again but must allow time to find parking."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Siddhartha G.,"'Woohoo as good as it gets' is just about right for Tavoláta, I don't believe I've had better Italian cuisine in recent memory. My sample space though is only the bay area, but San Jose's Little Italy restaurants can hold their own.
The novelty factor at Tavoláta is high, beginning with super-spicy Calabrian spice roasted pistachios and ending with hazelnut chocolate topped with the bitterest grapefruit marmalade you'll ever have. Get it while you can, when I tried asking for the marmalade's source they told me it's only temporarily on the menu.
And of course, if the start and the end are so good, how could they falter on the middle course? Main entreé was a cheesy sumptuous semolina ravioli delight, the Gnocchi alla Romana.
It would be worth coming back to Seattle just to eat at Tavoláta again."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Kristen K.,"My best friend in Seattle recommended this restaurant as his favorite Italian spot in the city, so we decided to make a reservation when a group of us were in the city.
It was a rainy Sunday evening and the restaurant was not too full when we came in for our reservation.
We each order our own dishes and I got to try some of my friend's dishes as well. Everything was very well plated and delicious (al dente)!!
Food:
Pappardelle - My friend and I split the Pappardelle and the spaghetti. I like the pappardelle more because it was a meat sauce and I haven't had an anchovy sauce before on my pasta. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and a pretty sizeable portion.
Anchovy Spaghetti with side meatballs - Meatballs were delicious! The spaghetti was a bit more fishy than I expected, but I liked the pasta overall. It was just more overpowering than I thought.
My friends all seemed very happy with their pasta dishes (also the salumi board was excellent). We all pretty much cleaned up all of the food somehow. I think the bucatini might have been a clear winner of the pastas though.
Overall, really delicious Italian restaurant in Capitol Hill. Very nice space and excellent service. Definitely would recommend coming here to try some delicious pastas!"
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Kevin Z.,"Pretty run of the mill Italian fare. We had a large table come in for a birthday dinner. We ordered the rigatoni, papparadelle, tagliatelle, spaghetti and meatballs, hanger steak, and porchetta. The pastas were ultimately forgettable as the flavors and textures were decent but nothing special. Visually, the porchetta was stunning but came to our table very cold and had to be reheated. The dish ended up being disappointing because it was fairly one dimensional favor wise.
Overall, service was great but food left much to be desired."

From service to food, every experience I've had has been wonderful. The restaurant is very accommodating of big groups, staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and careful with food allergies. The kitchen is on it! Food is fresh and delicious. Menu is fun and adventurous, and talk about that happy hour menu too.The atmosphere is trendy yet sophisticated.
Just go, you won't regret it, maybe make a reservation ahead of time. It's the little things, the attention to detail that add up into one great experience. I'm determined to try everything on their menu!"
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Cary H.,"Trendy Italian restaurant with friendly, accommodating staff and well-dressed diners. The happy hour crowd brightens the room and it quiets down after 7.
We ordered almost half the menu and ate family style. Ingredients were of high quality and very fresh. The preparation was disappointing. Some entrees were were bland, and others were over seasoned. The branzino was overcooked into a dry mess. Also pasta was inconsistent, varying from hard/al-dente to mushy soft. Only standout was the perfect lamb-mousse bruschetta.
Yelp pictures and trendy menu are deceiving. Happy hour prices for a quick bite/cocktail is probably fine. But for fine Italian dining, Tavolàta is just not there. I have high hopes they can work on consistent preparation as those guys in the kitchen seem like they are really trying."
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Ellen C.,"This place is always consistent in terms of food and service. Came back during Seattle Restaurant Week ($35 for 3 courses). Got an appetizer (salumi board), an entree (opted for the confit chicken instead of pasta since I always get pasta here), and dessert (panna cotta). Loved every single thing as usual!
I was also introduced to the Zeppole (lemon donuts with powdered sugar that you dip into a chocolate sauce) which was AMAZING. GAH. Next time I head to Tavolata I'm definitely ordering that for dessert."

Fresh pasta that's perfectly aldente with light and flavorful meatballs and a rich red sauce. The portion is pretty big too. I believe it was under $15.
The gnocchi is not you typical baby pillows. These are fluffy euro pillows tucked in a cute baby casserole dish- blanketed with sauce. The gooey cheese helps too!"
Tavolàta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 420-8355,Carmen V.,"Great to remember Italian sounding restaurants you marked in your mental 'to try' list from a previous visit to Seattle. In this case, remembering the Tavolata name saved my night, as my colleague and I were literally fighting and almost grabbing each other's hair to go and have dinner together somewhere were we both could enjoy. My colleaguefriend is Indian and somehow picky with her food intake.
Myself, I am in ketosis mode and with bad mood for cutting bread from my diet plus all that sugar...therefore irritable. Tavolata saved our night. My colleaguefriend enjoyed her pasta (al dente, not hard! ) and I definitively went fully keto, with that halibut in romesco sauce and shared an octopus carpaccio mega delicious with her. Also, had an non alcoholic cocktail that was so good you forgot it has no alcohol in it.
Great quality food and very nice atmosphere. Looks like mostly customers were pretty girls in pairs (well, not talking for ourselves in this case) and some matc.com kind of couples just on a first date. Packed but fast and friendly service."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Jessica L.,"This is my favorite pasta place in Seattle! I heard so many great things about it for a few years but finally tried it this past March. The pasta is fresh and the sauces are delicious. Even though the wait was super long (about 90 min)on a Friday in August, it was honestly worth the wait.
One of my favorites was the spicy sauce pasta with octopus. The menu changes daily so make sure to check out their Instagram page before you head there."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Phillip N.,"Unique pastas everyday, high quality ingredients, delicious food!
Il Corvo deserves the hype it gets. I recommend checking their Instagram before you go to see what their daily pstas are, but if you're too lazy, their bolognese is always a solid go-to pasta. The pasta has a very nice bite to them and the meat is very savory and packs a heavy punch.
The line gets long but doesn't stay stagnant."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Dione L.,"If you are trying to find the best pasta in Seattle. Its going to be right here. The line and preparing to wait in a line isn't just the hype. The hype is seriously real. Please get the salad and focaccia if you're going to wait the whole time. I always get their bolognese because its just so good. I literally have dreams about the pasta and most importantly with sauce.
This place is truly unique because they post/ rotate their menu everyday and they only keep the bolognese. SOOOO GET THE BOLOGNESE.
Service is great and the resty is a VIBE."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Jason L.,"I finally got around to dining here and I'm so glad I did! Since they're only open on the weekdays during lunch time, it makes dining here pretty inconvenient. Unless you work in the area or have the day off, coming out here might prove to be a little tough. If you do decide to come here, let me advise you to come at 10:30, 30 minutes before they open. You'd rather wait 30 minutes outside than possibly 1+ hours outside.
The menu rotates daily and they only have 3 pasta options. The day we went, they had pappardelle, orecchiette and torchiette. If you're unsure what type of pasta each one is, they have sample ones in front of the cash register so you can see. We decided to get one of each since it's such a pain to get out here. The portion sizes aren't too big since it's lunch time so I think two people can easily finish 3 orders. The pastas are delicious! They're all cooked perfectly al-dente and perfectly chewy. All three were amazing but I probably enjoyed the torchiette the best since it was the cheesiest of them all. Don't get me wrong though, they were all great!"
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Mia C.,"For the price, portion, and quality of the pasta, iL Corvo is solid. However, I would not wait in line for over an hour to come here vs others in the area like Pasta Castalinga or Due Cucina, where there is no line. The pesto pasta and signature parpardelle were both good, and I love the olive oil they use here. Their open hours are only suited for people who are able to come at 10:45am, and even then it would be a 45 min wait before being able to eat. Not convenient. Good pasta."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Victoria C.,"I've been so excited to come to this place due to all the hype around it. I might have come on a slightly off day though.
We came the day after Christmas around 10:45 AM, 15 minutes before they open. And they aren't kidding when they say if you don't want to wait that long to come around 10:30 AM to get in line. The line was long. And it might have been because a lot of people were off the day after Christmas, so why not come to get some delicious pasta.
You order once you get to the front, and the cashier will tell you where to sit. Like everyone else says, they do have a good system. They bring out pasta to you pretty fast, you eat, bus your own tables, and just get moving. There always seemed to be an open seat right when you got to the register. My husband and I got all 3 of the pastas, an order of the housemade focaccia bread, the kale salad, the proscuitto, and one of the dulche de leche cookies. The bread was the best part of the meal, although I do wish it was a little warmer. But I understand that they're trying to get it out orders as fast as possible. The kale salad was fine, as we the proscuitto.
When the pasta finally came out, we weren't blown away. To us, the base of the pasta dishes kind of all tasted the same. I was hoping the bolognese would be a little more flavorful, but it was just okay. They do have take out boxes for you to grab on your own as well.
For the line and wait, I probably wouldn't come back here. We didn't find the wait worth it honestly. The parking around the area is pretty scarce as well. There are some lots where you pay $10 an hour. Otherwise street parking is going to take you a little while to find."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Mandi W.,"I stupidly came here at lunchtime... Whyyyyyyyyyy?!?!?!
1 hr 9 minutes later, we're finally seated. That line is deceiving though. You have your outside line... But once you get to the front you realize there's an inside line lol. Whyyyyyy?!?!
Anyways, once you make it to the front of the inside line, you order, find your seat, and staff will bring your food out. Once finished, bus your own table and be on your way.
Their pasta menu changes daily except for the pappardelle. We got that and the campanelli. Both had great flavor, and noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly al dente.
They'll seat you at any open table so you'll most likely be joining another party. Obviously parties of two are easiest here and it seemed most common.
Tldr: good pasta, long lines, not sure if it's worth that wait. I'll try again at an off time. Stay tuned."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Phil H.,"Absolutely loved the whole experience here.
We were in town for a few days to explore Seattle before our Alaskan cruise and wanted to hit up a spot for lunch where the locals eat. II Corvo was highly recommended.
As advertised, there is a wait and the line can be long. We got on it and patiently waited. Moved decently overall and we got in after a while.
You head up to the main counter and place your order. Staff is very friendly and will find you a spot to eat, even if there is a small wait until other diners finish up. It's not the biggest place and it was packed while we were there. Was told this is pretty much the norm. Even so, they found our group of five a table within minutes.
The delicious house made pasta arrives fairly quickly. You grab your own napkins, utensils, water, and clean up after yourself once you're done. Each day they feature different pastas. At only $10 a plate it's super affordable. We each ordered different pastas to taste and share. Loved it.
Oh snap that focaccia bread. It's pretty awesome. It's the crack of carbs. Dipping oil too. The kale salad blew my socks off. I hate kale, as do most of my group, but we fought over this bowl and devoured it.
One of the best lunch experiences we had while on vacation."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Rebecca B.,"I was visiting family for the holidays and waited in line on Christmas Eve for 40 minutes starting at 10:20am before opening and have no regrets. There was a line to the corner block by 10:30. My little brother, an aspiring chef, made me watch the Eater episode featuring Il Corvo the night before, but it didn't take much convincing to wait in the cold with him in order to be one of the first customers in the door.
We ordered a feast of the kale salad, focaccia, pappardelle bolognese (the staple signature dish), pasticcio, and wine. The menu changes and Il Corvo announces daily what three pasta dishes will be served that day. Tip: check Instagram for updates. You can't go wrong whatever you order. The kale salad had a delightful crunch with a lemon dressing and generously sprinkled cheese. The house focaccia is unlike any focaccia I've ever had. There is no way to accurately describe the doughy, chewy, fluffy goodness. The quality and ingredients is unlike any other. The pasta itself was everything the reviews said it would be. Each pasta dish is reasonably priced at just over $10. I'm convinced I won't find pasta like this anywhere near me in Colorado and I'll be waiting in line again during my next visit.
My only regret about Il Corvo is that it is a quite small restaurant. Since word of its superior pasta has spread, there is a line that extends from the front register where you order and pay and wraps out onto the block. You will likely share a table (family style) in order for Il Corvo to serve more customers. I think this is actually a fun family-like environment but others may find it stifling as people bustle next to you waiting in line as you try to enjoy your food. Nevertheless, the pasta is worth it."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Kathy M.,"Our first day in Seattle as we were wandering around, we passed a long line of people waiting outside this tiny Italian restaurant. The weather was not great, so of course, I had to ask someone what was going on and WAS THIS LONG LINE WORTH THE WAIT.....I was told with an emphatic YES that this place was definitely worth a line and was given a brief summary of what to expect if we chose to try it out. We saved it for our last day on the hopes that a Monday might not be as busy as a Friday. Turns out, that this place is just busy! We arrived at 10:30 and took our place in line and our party of 8 walked out of this fine establishment at 12:40. Overall, everyone agreed that it was definitely worth the wait!! Their daily menu items are listed on a blackboard that you have more than enough time to read while you wait in line to order. In fact, because you are standing in line for the register in the middle of the 2 rows of tables, you also have ample opportunity to check out what the dishes look like as they are brought out to the other customers. This staff is amazing!!! They are friendly, efficient and seem to love where they work. No matter how improbable it seems, by the time you order and are looking for a place to sit, there is one available for you. Granted, everyone seems to understand that this is not the place to while away the hours and disregard all of the customers waiting in line.
Having said all of that, the food itself was wonderful. Fresh pastas, house focaccia and a kale salad that hubby has even mentioned to others because he feels it needs to be ordered (he is not a salad guy!). On our day, we sampled Pappardelle and Fusilli with rutabaga purée and loved both of them. I strongly believe that this kitchen knows what they are doing and you should trust their flavor combinations.
No matter how daunting the line looks, if you can make the time and are open to ordering what the chef has created, this place will not disappoint you!"
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Rachel Z.,"I visited Seattle over Thanksgiving and decided to try Il Corvo after one of my friends raved about it. We arrived right at 11am on a Wednesday and the line was already around the corner! We ended up waiting around 1 hour and 15 minutes before we ordered our food at the counter. One thing that really stuck out to me was how reasonably priced the pasta was ($11 each). There are only 3 pasta entrees available to order each day. With a table of 3, we ordered 2 kale salads and one of each pasta offered that day: Pappardelle, Pasticcio, and Calamaretti.
The kale salad was really good. Not a surprise that almost everyone orders it. It's light and very refreshing. My favorite pasta was the Calamaretti, which had a really rich saffron and calamari broth. The Pasticcio was heavier and cheesy because it was baked in a pomodoro sauce. My least favorite was the Pappardelle because, despite the perfectly cooked pasta, the sauce was too dry.
Overall, I definitely think that the pasta at Il Corvo is great but I don't think I would wait in line again for over an hour to eat here. The atmosphere is also very hectic because there's a line of people through the middle of the restaurant. It's really crowded and because you have to bus your own table, it's a little bit of a headache navigating around the huge line of people when carrying dishes and glassware."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Jenny W.,"The line is worth it!!! Simple menu so they can focus on making their 3 pastas the bomb! If you're visiting Seattle, I would put this on a must visit list. Consider it one of their tourist attractions. You really can't go wrong with any of the 3 pastas they offer. Since they rotate their pasta choices periodically, order all 3 and share, in case the next time you're there, the one you didn't try is off the menu at the time of your visit."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Lindsey S.,"The famous Il Corvo is someplace that has been on my list of places to try out for a while, and so to be in between jobs, it gives me a lot of time to go out and explore. SInce Il Corvo is only open for lunch, I knew I had to go as soon as possible. I went at around 1PM on a weekday and was expecting a huge line and wait, but when I arrived, there were only about 4 people in front of me at the door. Of course inside, the line extends, but I stepped inside fairly quickly. The place does get very, very crowded, but what I loved is that you don't have people waiting around trying to fight for a table. Once you order, the person at the register will tell you where to sit. People seemed to come and go at a pace that was easy for everyone to get seated right after ordering. They have that system DOWN.
We ordered the pappardelle and conchiglinie pasta dishes, and started off with the house focaccia and prosciutto di parma. The two appetizers came out almost as soon as we sat down. The focaccia-AMAZING. A must. Then prosciutto di parma was also DELICIOUS, and I would definitely order both again. The olive oil on the prosciutto was so fragrant ! The noodle dishes honestly, were not the BEST I've ever had, and I felt that I might have had too high of expectations, but they were satisfying. For the pappardelle, it was a little too hearty for me. I like pasta sauce to have a hint of sweetness, and the sauce for this dish wasn't that tomatoey. The cochinglinie was very salty and spicy, and it was good at first, but became a bit overpowering at the end.
I say that I would recommend Il Corvo to those visiting Seattle, and that the wait is worth to just try it out, but in terms of homemade pasta, there are other places that have the same quality for an equal price. Very good, and I will be back to curb my curiosity of their other dishes."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Johnny Y.,"I've been here twice with the most recent time being in Nov 2019. While Il Corvo serves really unique and delicious pasta dishes, I was extremely disappointed the last time I went because of certain cleanliness issues.
Food: I've tried the pappardelle and the calamaretti. The pappardelle was delicious with a nice balance of flavor between the sauce and the pasta. The pasta was al dente and cooked to perfection. The calamaretti was a tad bit salty for me but it had a rich seafood flavor. I really liked that it came with calamari as a topping for the pasta. The bread and olive oil was really the star of this place. I really enjoyed the soft fluffy bread with the oil.
Service and Cleanliness: We came around 12:30 and waited 2 hours to be served, but we expected the wait. The issue arose when we found a piece of hair in the calamaretti pasta. We showed the staff and they immediately got us a new plate quickly. However, we found another long piece of hair in the Kale salad. I'm disappointed that it happened twice and I hope they have higher hygiene standards in the future.
Price: Really worth it.
Overall, I wasn't the biggest fan after the second time. I like the dishes and the seasonal pasta offerings, but finding hair in the food definitely made me lose my appetite."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Mike N.,"So the question is...Is it worth waiting in line in the rain for 30 minutes to get inside and wait another 20 minutes before you order? Yes! Small restaurant so you need to wait for tables to open before being seated but service is quick upon ordering. Menuu is limited to three lunch entrees. They always have the bolognese and two specials. $10.95 each. Pasta is homemade. Today was Lumache with celery root in a pepper cream sauce and Lasagna with chickpeas, kale and tomatoes in a bay cream sauce. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not overpowering and did taste like red pepper. I'm a fan of vegetarian lasagna and loved this one. The blend of vegetables with the cheese was extraordinary. And yes, it was rich. We also ordered sides of focaccia (good-not too oily and perfect for dipping in sauce), kale salad (not a fan of Kale Salad but the dressing made this dish) and a Dulce de Leche shortbread cookie as we needed something sweet to complete the meal Total tab with tip for two was just over $40. You'll walk out needing to go the gym and saying, I'm coming back!"
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Toni L.,"Word. Waited in a 45 min line with my sister on a Monday morning (around 11:45am). The line moved quickly and there are plenty of hungry visitors that are right in the same boat with you. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is small and quaint, the line cuts through the middle and shared tables line the left and right sides of the restaurant.
You order everything at the counter and the chalkboard menu is revised daily, i heard. Dude taking the orders is super chill and patient despite the chaos of so many people bustling in and out. I saw many kale salads and a delicious looking caramel shortbread cookie on majority of the tables so we decided to get those. My sister also ordered the focaccia and then we each ordered our own pastas - i had a vegetarian one (sorry, forgot the name) and my sister ordered the bolognese pappardelle. Waters are self serve (there's wine available too) and then you are instructed on where to sit.
Love the homey, elbows touching, lively jazz vibes here. The food was absolutely worth the hype and wait. Pasta is perfectly firm and chewy and not to mention super affordable ($9.95 a plate). Sauces are simmered to perfection and i was blown away by the flavor on the kale salad as well as the rich intoxicating olive oil that came for dipping with the fresh baked crispy on the outside /fluffy on the inside focaccia.
Caramel cookie was also the perfect end to a hearty authentic Italian meal - shortbread was light and flaky and sandwiched in between was an amazing layer of soft caramel.
If you're on the fence i would 100% recommend giving it a shot. Also line seems to die down pretty dramatically around 2pm so if you don't mind a late lunch I'd say that's the way to go. PASTA FO LIFE"
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Tina Z.,"We came on a Friday about 1 hour after the restaurant opened. I was absolutely amazed at the line that was already wrapping around the block and even contemplated on eating somewhere else.
We ended up waiting about an hour and 15 mins prior to order. To think I almost didn't try this place saddens me because what a one-of-a-kind this place is. We got their two daily specials as well as their kale salad. Both pastas were literally the most perfectly al dente pasta I have ever had- there is absolutely no doubt the lines are long!
This place opens only for 4 lunch hours 5 days a week. Each day, they make two to three pasta dishes with ingredients all different from the last (menu announced every day about 1-2 hours before opening on Instagram). Some dishes have ingredients I normally would not order in my pasta, but if Il Corvo made it, I would definitely try it."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Jennifer H.,"If you're a pasta lover like me, you'll very much enjoy this little gem. Another fellow pasta lover brought me here and I was not disappointed.
There is always a line outside but it's there for a reason. It's the perfect lunch spot. I wish I could go every day just so that I don't miss a single dish they have to offer! Also love the fun antique decorations that gives the store so much character.
Their menu is updated daily with fresh ingredients. Unique handmade pasta with the most rich flavorful sauces! They also have other dishes besides pasta. I got their kale salad and it was delicious!"
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Lihan C.,"I think hands down my favorite place I went to in Seattle. There is a huge line for this place, but I thought it was worth it. I ordered the classic Bolognese and the Fiore that they had that day, as well as the focaccia. The focaccia was very soft and airy and the olive oil tastes super great. The bolognese is very hearty with meat and is very gritty, but very flavorful and tastes great. The fiore was HANDS DOWN my favorite. It was just a little bit tart and resembled something like a vodka/lemon sauce (although I think it was a different sauce the name escapes me now) it was very pretty and kind of a light orange in color.
The pasta here is perfectly cooked al dente. I was seated at the long table with a lot of other people just going there to enjoy the food and 2 other people took up my lead and also ordered 2 or all of the pastas offered that day. We made friends and everything was great. A lovely experience and I would definitely do the wait again since it was WORTH."
Il Corvo Pasta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 538-0999,Vee V.,"Yep, there's a wait, yep the focaccia is amazing.
I arrived 30 minutes before closing so they were selling out of a couple items, it must have been their flavorful items cause we ended up with their pappardelle alla bolognese and orecchiette with pesto, it was just okay.
Once you order they tell you where to sit if you're dining in, the pasta comes fairly quickly. You grab your own water, napkins, utensils, and bus your own table once you're done.
The bread, yes, they ish is herbaceous, soft with a crunchy crust, and perfectly enhanced by the dipping oil. This was our favorite bite of the meal. The pastas were cooked well, but the pappardelle was way over salted, it was almost inedible. The orecchiette didn't knock my socks off, it was fine.
Factoring in the wait, this isn't a place I must come back to."
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Jennifer H.,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Pasta Bella is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. Its a small hole in the wall. The space is tiny and there's always a wait for a table but totally worth it. Not only does the decor feel so cozy and authentic but also the food.
I've been here multiple times for many events and it truly never disappoints. The bread that is served is so divine with the olive oil and balsamic. They also have olive oil roasted garlic you can ask for on the side. The Penn Cove mussels is a great appetizer.
Every single pasta I have tried has been delicious. My all time favorite is the Fettuccine Marsala Fungi!!! Ugh best pasta ever. Their noodles are made to order.. always made and cooked perfectly. Also the Six Layer lasagna is a must try.
My mom loves pasta and is pretty hard to impress with food - as she is a cook herself. I took her here for her birthday and she absolutely loved it.
I would recommend making a reservation. Also make sure you get the deal on Yelp, $20 for $10!!"
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Jensen M.,"It seemed like this restaurant still felt like a work in progress though the food was promising. It's relatively close to our house and there was a yelp coupon so we thought we would give it a try. The location is not in the downtown Ballard which I think is a perk as parking was ample.
The pasta was good but the service was slow. A single server takes all the orders of the restaurant, everyone else has dedicated roles too. Everyone was nice and the pricing was fair."
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Sung S.,"Food price was a bit pricy
Food itself was 3/5
The atmosphere is like going to someone home and felt a little crowded even though the place was pretty empty.
If the price was less expensive this would be a good place to eat.
Spaghetti was little watery
Halibut with pasta was good
Bruschetta was a bit overcooked where it was pretty much burnt but at least the flavor was good"
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Spat S.,"Always great pasta here, if a little on the heavier side. Lasagna is peRfection! Love the huge menu and service is always good. Don't forget to try the desserts too. Feels like you can't go wrong here! Would recommend!"
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Nathan W.,"Time: Saturday 8:30pm
Service: 3/5 They seem a bit understaffed because the place wasn't even half full but it took about 15 minutes for a party of 2 to get seated even though it was past peak dinner time... Once we got seated, the waitresses were very friendly though and made sure we got our bread, water, and orders taken.
Ambiance: 4/5 2 main dining rooms with a bunch of Mona Lisa paintings and old pictures/paintings on the wall. It's a little dim inside and I'm not a big fan of the color scheme and decorations. Not the most visually appealing.
Parking: 4/5 Free parking in the lot next to the restaurant. Parking lot is a bit small, but there is also free parking on the surrounding streets.
Food: 5/5 I ordered the Penne Salsiccia Gorgonzola ($18) and my friend got the Linguini Carbonara with Sausage ($17 + $4). This is probably the best Italian place I have had so far in Seattle. Both pastas had amazing texture and the sauces were very tasty without being too heavy. Portions were also very big. The pancetta was a little salty, but that's ok. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Italian pasta. I will definitely be returning to try their other pastas. I have also heard the dessert is amazing. Prices are a little on the higher side, but the food is so good that it's definitely worth it!
Overall: 3*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 5*0.7 = 4.6"
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Mackenzie C.,"Super cute, casual restaurant. We started with the gnocchi pomodoro and it was so fresh and the sauce was amazing. For my main dish, I had the Capellini Gamberi Alfredo and it was so so yummy. My boyfriend had the chicken risotto which he enjoyed. The portions were huge - we both took food home, which is surprising as normally when we go out my boyfriend finishes his meal and whatever is left of mine. Really great spot for a casual, but still amazing, dinner."
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Nancy N.,"This place was amazing!!!! Luckily we made a reservation through the yelp app an hour prior because it's a smaller, cozy restaurant for sure. A handful of people waiting who didn't make reservations when we got there but they still got seated within 20 mins. Ordered a ton of food including mussel appetizers, two bottles of wine, fettuccine, lasagna, and much more. Everything was extremely yummy.
Our waitress was the sweetest and one of our dishes was taking longer to come out, so she gave us a complimentary dessert. Also amazing
Overall 5/5. Can't help that there's a wait for yummy restaurants, so make sure you make a reservation."
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Aline R.,"I had reservations for the restaurant of Christmas Eve. Did it through their own website, got a confirmation email and went with my life. The day of I called them to confirm and nobody picked it up, SUPER RED FLAG. When me and my husband got there the place was closed. Just that, we ended up scrambling around to find another restaurant since all place open we're operating on reservations and we didn't have one. While we're walking around Ballard Ave to find a new place we heard of people who also had the same problem. So disappointed with this place."
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Ellie Sam R.,We had no reservation and they were packed but the wait wasn't long. Thank you for putting up with our fussy little eater and not being snobbish about our shared portions. Have it down for a solo date on our anniversary and for special family occasions.
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Dan C.,"We walked in on a Saturday night and waited only 30 minutes. The service was amazing, the servers, hostes, busser, manager, everyone was so kind. This is the perfect place for a nice date or any occasion. The food was some of the best Italian food I've had in Seattle. I highly suggest eating here! You won't be disappointed, especially if you cherish service that exceeds expectations.
We will definitely be back soon!!"
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Adam S.,"Easily the best Italian Food I have had in Seattle to date. I'm sad it took me two years to find this gem but so happy that I finally did.
I went with my parents and we were able to order a good bit of food (super reasonably priced) to try.
Every dish tasted fresh and packed with flavor. Definitely did not skimp on the portion sizes as well.
We also got the calamari as an app (sautéed not fried) with olives and tomatoes - it was out of this world.
Go here. Eat here. Come back again and again!"
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Crystel T.,"I can only review on an order through Door Dash. First off, the food was packaged really well and was delicious. The gnocchi pomodoro appetizer was really good - loved the sauce! I had the Penne Gorgonzola with sausage and mushroom. I'm usually a red sauce person, but it was quite tasty. Now the lasagna my BF ordered - AMAZING. Let's just say, I took more than a bite from his plate. Lol. Can't wait to try this this place out in person."
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Zacarias D.,"I decided to try out Pasta Bella for dinner on this Sunday night because I have driven past the restaurant a million times in Ballard and I'm glad I came to try it out.
The scenery of the restaurant is very old fashioned Italian feel. The hostess greets you with a wine menu. All of the pasta's and dishes are very authentic. I had a great spicy wine sauce linguine pasta and the noodles were Al dente! With my pasta I had a glass of Pinot Grigio that went perfect with the pasta.
For dessert I had the TiraMisu which was delicious chocolate had a coffee taste and was moist. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic pasta. This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary with your loved one or even just a date. I will be back for a special occasion."
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Viraj H.,"Pasta Bella is a cute little italian restaurant in Ballard. It's a great alternative to the upscale italian restaurants you generally find, and has an old school charm to it.
The restaurant feels like you're walking into a house. They have two separate rooms/sections, both pretty identical. The decor isn't very fancy, but rather cozy and homely, and the ambiance is pretty quiet. Great low-key date place.
Though the place is pretty large, most of their tables seat four, so a large group may not be the best here.
The food was delicious. We tried four different pastas, and they were very good. I specially liked their raviolis.
We got a half bottle of wine, but surprisingly it was served in a carafe, not in a bottle. I wasn't very happy of how it was served, and would have preferred some clarity on that upfront.
The service, though mostly fine, seemed lacking in warmth. Our original server was very friendly and helpful, but the manager/owner? lady seemed very cold and rude. They kept switching servers on us, and the lady seemed annoyed with our requests for water refills. They forgot our soup (and didn't charge for it as well), which was pretty surprising, but not a big deal.
The prices are at par with the competition, sort of on the higher side for a comparable restaurant.
Overall, it's a cool place worth going to occasionally. Not my favorite italian restaurant, but not bad either. Would recommend!"
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Raj S.,"This is one good Italian restaurant we've been to. The ravioli and gnocchi were amazing! Minestrone soup personally didn't like it much. But my friends loved it.

Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,T R.,"Had Christmas Eve reservations at 5:30pm for four but the restaurant was not open. Two other parties showed up for their dinner reservations while we were there and also went away hungry. Some very unhappy people in that parking lot. Funny that PastaBella could not take the time to reach out and cancel the reservations; not even an explanatory sign on the door! It will be a distant day before we give them another chance.
BTW, I emailed Mike@PastaBella with news of the reservation issues and never even received the courtesy of a reply. Very poor form."
Pasta Bella,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 789-4933,Marco M.,"This meal was a disaster. The food was about 3 stars but the service was so awful I'd give zero stars if possible.
My wife and I are on vacation in Seattle with another couple. They took us out the previous night so we wanted to treat them to a nice meal tonight. Since our last vacation together was in Rome I thought Italian food would be a good choice.
I made a reservation for 4 through Yelp and we arrived right at 7:30. We were greeted and seated promptly. A few minutes later our server brought water, warm bread and olive oil. So far, so good.
We ordered appetizers and entrees. We drank water, asked for refills as it was a hot day and the restaurant did not have air conditioning. We asked for more bread. 45-60 minutes went by with no food. My wife asked the host and she explained that they were short staffed. She said to let her know if there was anything she could do. There seemed to be four tables occupied so it wasn't crowded but I think there was only one cook. It would have been nice if we had been warned there would be a very long wait for food BEFORE we were seated, or at the very least, before we ordered. We shouldn't have had to ask where our food was. Also, they could have offered complimentary drinks at that point.
The appetizers came soon after our inquiry. My wife and one guest enjoyed the shrimp pesto appetizer. We also had the special sun-dried tomato pistachio crostini. Two of us liked it, two did not. We also had the gnocchi in creamy tomato sauce which was ok. And I had the Caesar that was also just ok.
Then we waited. And waited and waited. The host cleared the appetizer dishes and asked if we wanted dessert menus. We explained that we were still waiting for our entrees. Perhaps she was embarrassed, who knows, but from that moment on she became rude and unpleasant - details to follow.
Our entrees finally arrived a full 90 minutes after we were seated. One guest and I split the puttanesca and a vegetarian version of the gnocchi. My wife and other guest shared Halibut with citrus sauce and linguini Amatriciana. All of the pasta was over cooked. The puttanesca sauce was fine. The gnocchi was ok. My wife liked the halibut but our friend didn't care for it. By the time the food arrived we were rather irritated.
The waiter said he would comp dessert and drinks. He cleared the table while my wife was still eating and even brought dessert menus before she had finished her meal. Only two of us wanted dessert and three coffees. They tried to get cappuccino or espresso but the waiter said the machine was broken. RIGHT. Then they asked for plain coffee. He said that since they closed at nine it was too late to make it. I pushed back saying it wasn't our fault that we waited an hour an a half to be served entrees. He acquiesced and brought out two decafs. The host brought out the two desserts and practically slammed them down on the table. Then the coffees and one tea arrived. She brought out a handful of little tiny portions of half and half and flung them onto the table. All of this with no eye contact or one word from her. After she left we had to laugh because her behavior was so ridiculous.
Then we waited and waited for the bill. We finally were getting up to leave to pay at the register when the bill came. At that point the host said some pleasantry as if she hadn't been awful for the past several interchanges.
I usually tip 20% or more on the entire bill but I only left $10 which was 10% of the pretax bill. In retrospect, I should have left nothing. The waiter wasn't rude, he just didn't let us know there would be serious issues in getting our food and then made a grand gesture of comping things he didn't have or wasn't willing to make.
Mediocre food and horrible service. We have another week in town and you can be sure we will not return here."

Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Mike V.,"Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,David P.,"Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"

Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Nicole A.,"I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Thao N.,"First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.

Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Zeena R.,The food was fine but the owner started arguing with some other guests about the freshness of the seafoood and that soured how much I enjoyed myself.
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Jordan N.,"I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Jacqueline H.,"Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!"
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Gabrielle B.,Great spot for a special dinner with friends. The homemade oil is outstanding on top of the pasta.
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Janhavi B.,"Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Lynden L.,"My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Raquel M.,Nope. Terrible food and subpar service. My expectations were perhaps unreasonably high given the website's description of the chef's experience. The bread provided as a starter was neither fresh nor toasted. It had the distinct preservative flavor of poor quality bread. The pesto served with the bread was cold and reminiscent of the flavor of grocery store pesto. Our server was more interested in high dollar tables where cocktails were ordered and it was difficult to get his attention. I had the pesto di pomodori secchi alla puttanesca and the anchovy smell and flavor overpowered everything else. I typically can't get enough pasta but could not finish this dish. My husband had the manicotti al forno and while it was good the walnut flavor was overpowering. The price of our meal was not commensurate with its quality. We've had cheaper meals that were tastier and higher quality. I wish we had skipped this place.
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Jenny H.,"FOOD: Ordered a few different pastas named as their ""popular dishes"" and they were all mediocre. 6/10
SERVICE: Good. Waitress came to check in frequently. Prompt. Courteous. 9/10
**Important to note. One big letdown for me and will be for all parents with babies/toddlers: NO HIGHCHAIRS PROVIDED HERE."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Amanda I.,"I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Sloan C.,"Went there last Friday night. Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Christina T.,"My boyfriend and I came here for date night and it has become our favorite ""hidden gem"" that turned into an anniversary tradition. We love pasta.
Their restaurant is a small space and being that they're only open 5-11pm, I'd recommend going during the week.
Their bread and dip appetizer is to die for! It's light and fluffy and appetizers set you in for the rest of the meal to come. My boyfriend got the Linquine con Gamberie and I got the Penne Pasta alla Vodka. Delicious, delicious, delicious. If you like everything with a bit of spice like myself, just ask for their sauce! Someone will come by and give you a teaspoon full of their secret sauce.
Customer service is great. The intimate feel of the restaurant is amazing. It's a great place to dine!"
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Annalise W.,"Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Alex O.,"Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
Pomodoro,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food,(206) 324-3160,Artemis L.,"I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
